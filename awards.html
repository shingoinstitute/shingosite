                                        <h5>The Art and Science of Organizational Transformation</h5>
                                        <p>Many companies conduct Lean training and projects, but few have tapped the wealth of ideas in the minds of their staff like Baylor Scott &amp; White Health. This book documents the path Steve Hoeft and Robert Pryor created at Baylor Scott &amp; White Health and shares what worked as well as what didn’t—illustrating over seven years of successes and failures in detail.</p>
																				<p>Providing easy-to-follow guidance for deploying Lean and TPS in healthcare, The Power of Ideas to Transform Healthcare focuses on what needs to be done and who needs to do it. It explains that the new "currency" for 2015 and beyond will be ideas—ideas brought out in projects, problem solving, and especially in "Huddles." The most significant concept in this book is not huddles. Instead it’s who builds the systems around them and why.</p>
																				<ul style="list-style: inherit; margin-left: 2em;">
																					<li>Supplies the understanding required to build a Lean management system in any industry</li>
																					<li>Explains how to align staff around common goals and cascade and translate those goals using Hoshin Kanri</li>
																					<li>Demonstrates how daily Lean can reduce the cost of healthcare</li>
																				</ul>
																				<p>The authors share hundreds of pictures, forms, tools, and tips. Describing how to engage all staff and draw out their ideas in daily huddles, the book offers ways that staff can try out their ideas without spending too much time away from their work.</p>
																				<p>Although the book focuses on healthcare, the management systems described, along with the lessons learned and best practices, will work in almost any industry.</p>

                                        <h5>Making Scientific Thinking a Life Skill for Everyone</h5>
                                        <p>The Improvement Kata pattern is a better way for learning and developing the capabilities of our most valuable resource: our employees. Shigeo Shingo noted that continuous improvement means trying something we’ve not done before — treading into unexplored territory. Yet, most organizations task employees with entering into uncharted waters as if it is already familiar. The results are almost always disappointing both to employee and manager.</p>
                                        <p>Using an example familiar to most, learning to drive, GBMP compares traditional “push system” learning with the Improvement Kata method, which redefines the manager’s role as coach and enabler. Many humorous moments in Anna’s learning process underscore the benefits of the structured, scientific Kata approach. In the end, Anna learns a valuable “meta-skill”, a deliberate, scientific method that can be universally applied to any challenge she may face. Whether in our personal or work lives, achieving challenging goals requires a set of practiced skills and a social environment that support a scientific approach to problem-solving. The challenge to kaizen — small changes for the better — requires a set of practiced skills that create a social environment supporting the technical science of problem-solving. This video of Anna’s driving lessons provides an introduction to the critical importance of Kata methodology to real human development.<p>

                                        <h5>HOW TO LINK STRATEGY TO DAILY PRACTICES</h5>
                                        <p>Every day individuals enthusiastically accept prominent roles in companies around the globe. Not long thereafter, their initial excitement is tempered by an uncertainty epitomized in three questions:
                                        <ul class="square">
                                            <li>How do things really work around here?</li>
                                            <li>Who does what and where do I fit in?</li>
                                            <li>What can I do to move the ball forward?</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>What they quickly discover is <strong>their role did not come with instructions.</strong> And no one waits for them to get up to speed. The inbox bursts with wildfires – lackluster sales, missed deadlines, marketing mishaps, and new competitors testing the market. What they need is <strong>an owner’s manual for managing and growing an enterprise</strong>, a structure for attacking the corporate chaos and lasering in on those critical items that determine success or failure – and that is exactly the book I have written, <strong><em>Customer Focused Process Innovation.</em></strong></p>
                                        <p>The answers to the above questions rely on how the company organizes work or more appropriately, processes. By my definition, processes are a collection of tasks that take inputs and create outputs. In fact, every company is a web of processes – with work completed at numerous stops before a finished product is delivered to a customer. For decades process improvement meant making products better, faster, and less costly, but there is a far greater power to processes.</p>
                                        <p>Consider for a moment that the web of connected processes is the unique way a company creates value – in effect, its strategy. It follows that if you calibrate the outputs of this process web to deliver exactly what the customer wants, you have created an incredibly efficient way to develop the perfect product. But how do you know what the customer wants? By capturing feedback from the points where your process web interacts with the customer, rich detail is readily available on the needs, wants, and dislikes of your customer. Success is managing this simplified relationship between the customer and your processes. This concept is the basis of <strong><em>Customer Focused Process Innovation</em> – building a process-based machine to deliver exactly what the customer wants as efficiently as possible.</strong> Embedding this power in the DNA of a company leads to the answers.<p>

                                        <p><strong>Building a Global Learning Organization: Using TWI to Succeed with Strategic Workforce Expansion in the LEGO® Group</strong> describes how a multinational company developed a global structure for learning based on the TWI (Training Within Industry) program to create and sustain standardized work across multiple language and cultural platforms. In this book, Shingo Prize-winning author Patrick Graupp collaborates with two practitioners who performed the planning and implementation of the LEGO Group’s worldwide Learning Organization.</p>
										<p>The book outlines the organizational and planning models used by the LEGO Group to create the internal ability to give and receive tacit skills and knowledge. Describing how and why TWI is used as the foundation for success in knowledge transfer across diverse languages and cultures, it provides step-by-step guidance on how to establish a solid organizational foundation for your own Learning Organization.</p>
										<p>Providing expert insight into the work of culture change, the book explains how to work with people to create motivation for moving to a new system of learning. It details the critical elements that made the implementation at the LEGO Group a success, identifies the stumbling blocks they encountered along the way, and explains how they were overcome. Case studies describe in detail what these efforts looked and felt like in actual application.</p>
										<p>The TWI program has long been recognized for its ability to generate results. After reading this book, you will gain valuable insight into how your organization—whether large or small, national or international—can integrate this timeless tool into your operating structure and your daily culture.</p>

                                        <p>Why are B2B sales and marketing problems so persistent? Why don't digital and social marketing, lead generation, sales training, CRM systems, and even so-called sales process improve sales productivity and profit?</p>
                                        <p>In Sales Process Excellence, Michael Webb traces sales and marketing problems to their root causes in traditional management methods, such as pushing product, setting quotas, and trying harder while doing the same things over again. He explains why these methods actually create barriers for leaders, and reveals an alternative that avoids them.</p>
                                        <p>What's the alternative? Sales process excellence. Drawing on years of experience with B2B sales managers, general managers, and process excellence leaders, Webb shows how you can engage your team to:
                                        	<ul class="square">
                                            	<li>Learn what customers want from your salespeople, your channels, and on your website</li>
                                                <li>Design your process to tell you who will buy, who won't, and why</li>
                                                <li>Increase margins and accountability, while earning field salespeople's cooperation and respect</li>
                                                <li>Synchronize marketing, sales, and service into a smooth production flow, and then accelerate it</li>
                                                <li>Use data you didn’t know you had to drive decisions that reliably grow your business</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>With nearly 40 case examples, Webb illustrates data-driven ways to motivate and guide sales and marketing teams with a precision approaching that of production operations.</p>
                                        <p>In this book, you will learn how:
                                        	<ul class="square">
                                            	<li>A food packager doubled sales productivity, creating a new market where no one else could compete</li>
                                                <li>A water filter distributor revived its growth by moving salespeople from servicing dealers to selling to new customers through those dealers</li>

                                            </ul>
                                        </p>Stop relying on wasteful promotions, undependable sales heroes, and management methods pitting people against one another. In this book you will learn proven principles for finding customer value and locking in profit in ways competitors can’t imitate, while increasing predictability and reducing business risks.</p>

                                        <p>Eastman Kodak Company is a well-known imaging and printing company that has been practicing lean manufacturing in its production and distribution operations for many years. Kodak manufactures a number of products with sufficient demand flow and volume relative to lot size so that its finishing operations are repetitive. For these products, it applies a production smoothing policy known as heijunka. Kodak's supply chain model also requires finished goods inventory to assure an immediate and reliable supply to customers. Appropriate inventory and production control policies are needed to satisfy stochastic demand at a qualified fill rate, and to set the cycle time per unit to replenish inventory at a level rate of supply. The lean production control process Kodak implemented initially was an elementary system of action limits prescribed by lean consultants. This system was difficult to interpret and performed erratically. Kodak replaced it with a new system based on operations research and statistical process control techniques, which analytically model the inventory and production control policies for stochastic demand and level supply. The new method improves operational control of lean manufacturing for a make-to-stock application that is realized in production schedule stability, product availability, and lower operating costs.</p>

This journey requires a commitment to quality improvement from the highest levels of leadership combined with the interdependent development of several key components of health care delivery: administration and governance, clinical leadership, quality programs and expertise, data analytics, and accreditation. As each health care organization travels along its journey, these components must evolve. With each component of a given phase of the quality journey firmly developed, the organization can expect to advance to the next phase knowing that the requisite factors are aligned.</p>

                                        <h6>Kim Barnas</h6>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>Hospitals have long relied on the heroics of one brilliant nurse or doctor to save the day. Such heroics often result in temporary workarounds and quick fixes that leave not only patients and quality care at risk, but also increase costs. This is the story of an organization breaking that habit. Like a growing number of healthcare organizations around the world, ThedaCare, Inc. has been using lean thinking and the principles of the Toyota Production System to improve quality of care, reduce waste, and become more reliable. But lean thinking was incompatible with ThedaCare’s old top-down, hero-based system of management. Kim Barnas, former SVP of ThedaCare, shows us how she and her team created a management system that is stable and lean, to spur continuous improvement.</p>
                                        <p>Beyond Heroes shows the reader, step-by-step, how ThedaCare teams developed the system, using the stories of its doctors, nurses, and administrators to illustrate lean principles. The book explores each of the eight essential components of the lean system, from front-line problem solving with the scientific method to daily team huddles and creating standard work for leaders all the way to the top of an organization. Finally, the author introduces four executives from healthcare systems across North America who have implemented ThedaCare’s system and share the lessons they learned along the way.</p>
                                        <p>Beyond Heroes is not just a call to action or an argument for a better healthcare system. It is a necessary roadmap through the rocky terrain ahead, one that healthcare leaders can customize to their special needs.</p>

                                        <p>Too many organizations today suffer from silo-centric behavior and intra-organizational conflict. Yet most don’t understand what’s holding them back from achieving outstanding performance.</p>
                                        <p>Value stream mapping—an essential but under-used methodology—is a proven approach to help you visualize and resolve disconnects, redundancies, and gaps in your value delivery system. More than merely a tool to eliminate operational waste, value stream mapping is a highly effective means to transform leadership thinking, define strategy and priorities, and create customer-centric work flow.</p>
                                        <p>In this detailed guide, business performance improvement experts Karen Martin and Mike Osterling present a practical way to deeply understand how work gets done—in any environment—and how to design improved work systems. You’ll learn how to:
                                            <ul class="square">
                                                <li>Prepare and engage your leadership team in the transformation process.</li>
                                                <li>Gain a deep understanding about your current work systems and the related barriers to delivering value.</li>
                                                <li>Design a future state that enables outstanding performance on all fronts.</li>
                                                <li>Adopt the new design and lay the foundation for continued improvement.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Whether you are a novice, experienced improvement practitioner, or senior leader, Value Stream Mapping will help you design and operate your business more effectively. And if your organization already uses value stream mapping, this book will help you improve your transformation efforts.</p>
                                        <p>In today’s rapid-fire business environment, there are too many problems to be solved and too many opportunities to be leveraged to operate without a highly effective means for accomplishing the important work to be done. Value stream mapping is the missing link in business management and, properly executed, has the power to address many business woes.</p>

                                        <p>For service organizations, the goal of continuous improvement has been at least as frustrating as attractive. But a recent compendium of articles and CXO interviews from McKinsey &amp; Company, The Lean Management Enterprise: A system for daily progress, meaningful purpose, and lasting value, shows how a select group of enterprises is pointing the way forward. What these organizations have in common is their commitment to a management system comprised of four core disciplines: delivering value efficiently to the customer, enabling people to lead and contribute to their fullest potential, discovering better ways of working, and connecting strategy, goals, and meaningful purpose. These disciplines unite the entire organization from the front line to the executive suite. The journey to explicitly design, use, and improve these disciplines is the key to unlocking continuous improvement faster and at scale.</p>
                                        <p>The six articles and ten executive interviews illustrate the four disciplines in greater detail, describing how each is evolving based on lean principles, in real organizations doing real work and facing real challenges. Understanding the full impact that lean management can offer is possible only by viewing these stories as part of a consistent system— one that delivers rapid improvement in performance and health while unlocking much greater value through continuous improvement over time.</p>

                                        <p>Modern manufacturing methodologies have undergone three different evolutionary stages over the past 200 years. Before there were modern manufacturing plants, the world only knew skilled craftsmen who labored as individuals in very small groups to produce goods and services. The first factory evolution came about when James Watt invented the steam engine. Metal cutting, forming and assembly machines were co-located near streams or rivers forming what we now call the Job Shop or the American Armory System. The second factory evolution began when Henry Ford introduced the first modern assembly line using interchangeable parts and standardized manufacturing procedures. This gave rise to the modern flow shop, which reached its zenith during WWII. In the late 1970s, the third industrial evolution began when Taiichi Ohno and the Toyota Motor Company introduced what we now call Lean Manufacturing...and the world changed again. Over the last 40 years, all forms of traditional manufacturing and service systems have embraced the concepts of Lean Thinking and proved its superiority to traditional manufacturing and service systems design.</p>
                                        <p>This book defines and characterizes a new breed of engineer which we call the <em>Lean Engineer.</em> The Lean Engineer has roots in traditional industrial engineering, but is also well trained in six-sigma methodologies and understands lean-to-green factory design principles. However, Lean Engineering transcends and redefines the classic industrial engineer. Principles of Lean systems design, U-shaped Lean manufacturing cells, Linked-Cell Manufacturing System design and Mixed Model final assembly lines are unique Lean Engineering strategies. This book attempts to define for the first time a new manufacturing engineering discipline called the Lean Engineering.</p>

                                        <p>Welcome to our view of the lean world. This workbook is designed to provide a clearer understanding of the fundamentals of the strategic lean philosophy and introduces methods for providing relevant, timely, and actionable information to the decision makers in a lean environment. The workbook is divided into three major parts: I) Lean as a competitive strategy; II) Lean accounting; and III) Accounting controls and transition. Each section of the three parts walks carefully through the tools, activities, and philosophies of the concepts presented, as well as provide real-world examples and addresses often asked questions about lean implementations. It is our objective that upon completion of this workbook, company personnel will be able to transition a traditional accounting system into one that is supportive of a lean environment. We believe that this improved information system will enhance decision making, improve strategic communications, motivate correct behaviors, empower employees, and ultimately add to your bottom line.</p>
                                        <p>To give a real-life perspective, the lean journey of an actual company (pseudonym Lean Manufacturer of Electrical Components (LMEC)) with specific illustrations and examples provided throughout the workbook. We are using LMEC because it is a firm that has made significant strides in its commitment to lean as a company culture. LMEC is a particularly excellent choice as an example for this workbook because it was one of the first identified companies that recognized the need to change its accounting system in support of its lean initiatives. We are especially grateful to the LMEC plant controller and managers who have willingly invested their time and efforts in helping us to share their story—both the successes and challenges they have experienced in trying to build a lean culture.</p>
                                        <p>This workbook is unique in that it focuses on steps, checklists, worksheets, and examples to make it easier for companies to visualize and plan the transition to better information for lean decision-making. Actual company examples and problems address practical concerns. Finally, the workbook directly confronts the fears that are often the source of accountants’ resistance to change. These stumbling blocks include inventory management and valuation, SOX issues, GAAP compliance, and loss of control and benchmarks. Each fear is identified and resolved in an inset ‘Fear Box’ as the related topic is discussed. By the end of the workbook, the issues surrounding these typical fears should be understood, dispelled, and resolved.</p>

                                        <h6>Paul Plsek</h6>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>The lean thinking concept of standard work is a particularly troublesome one to many healthcare professionals. This has led many in healthcare to believe that lean thinking is anti-innovation. Standard work, they say, stifles creativity and the foundational freedom to think and do differently, which is at the heart of innovation. So, to many in healthcare, it is remarkable to learn that the Virginia Mason Medical Center has integrated innovation and lean at both the strategic and operational levels. However, it turns out that creative thinking goes hand in hand with lean thinking. That remarkable concept—how it evolved and how it has contributed to the organization’s success story—is the subject of this book.</p>
                                        <p>Chapter 2 describes Virginia Mason’s strategic approach to innovation. Innovation is addressed systematically and deliberately, with involvement of the whole organization from the board of directors to the front line. Innovation in healthcare needs to be more than simply a word in a vision statement, or a wishful exhortation.</p>
                                        <p>Chapter 3 goes to the heart of the matter in providing examples of the integration of creativity and innovation methods into lean. Concepts and methods from the literature on creativity and innovation fit nicely with lean methodology and help to stretch thinking beyond incremental improvement. Lean is not anti-innovation after all.</p>
                                        <p>Chapter 4 focuses on how Virginia Mason builds leadership knowledge and capabilities with regard to innovation. When leaders know better, via systematic learning and unlearning, they can do better to catalyze and support innovation. Anyone can learn to be more creative and innovative.</p>
                                        <p>Chapter 5 describes how the organization measures and improves those elements of its culture that are known to support innovation. Organizational culture is key to success in both lean and innovation, and it can be created through deliberate and systematic effort.</p>
                                        <p>Chapter 6 covers Virginia Mason’s infrastructure for innovation. In contrast to many other healthcare organizations that are focusing on innovation, Virginia Mason maintains a minimal infrastructure that supports, facilitates, and teaches others, rather than creating a separate, centralized structure where innovative thinking occurs mainly outside the daily work of healthcare service delivery. Virginia Mason Medical Center believes that freedom to innovate is everyone’s privilege, not just that of a separate workgroup.</p>
                                        <p>Chapter 7 follows on naturally from the discussion about culture and minimal centralized infrastructure to highlight examples of creativity and innovation in the daily work of frontline team members. At Virginia Mason, frontline staff regularly take advantage of the opportunity to be innovative.</p>
                                        <p>Chapter 8 focuses specifically on how the voice of patients and families inspires innovation. Innovation is often triggered when we deeply understand the experience of patients and families, but it requires that we observe and listen well, and to the right things. Bringing into its lean efforts an innovative approach called experience-based design, Virginia Mason is showing that the patient and family experience can be measured and improved upon in ways that patients and families truly appreciate.</p>
                                        <p>Chapter 9 concludes by looking ahead strategically. While stories of success are already evident, the journey of the integration of lean and innovation has only just begun at Virginia Mason, and within American healthcare in general. Virginia Mason Medical Center has come a long way, but knows that it still has a long way to go.</p>
                                        <p>To make concrete an invitation to travel with Virginia Mason on its mission to transform healthcare, each chapter ends with a section that summarizes key points and raises challenging questions for reflection. This section is ideal for creating dialogue among leadership teams that are contemplating adding a deliberate effort on innovation to their healthcare organization’s strategy.</p>

                                        <p>In 2001 Virginia Mason Medical Center launched what may be the first hospital-wide experiment applying Toyota Production System thinking and practices to healthcare. In the interim, many healthcare organizations, including hospitals, clinics, and individual medical and dental practices, have incorporated a variety of lean practices and tools. While there has been significant progress, in many organizations that progress has been limited to localized improvement efforts in the form of “spot” kaizen or temporary improvements in process performance followed by failure to sustain.</p>
                                        <p>In <em>Perfecting Patient Journeys</em>, the authors, who have a combined 148 years applying lean in a variety of settings including healthcare, offer a step-by-step guide for using value stream improvement (VSI) methodology to make real and sustainable change to improve operational performance and to develop an adaptive, problem solving culture based on lean thinking and practices. As evidence the authors point to the following results achieved with the VSI methodology:</p>
                                        <ul class="disc">
                                            <li>Reduced annual staff turnover by 20%</li>
                                            <li>Reduced average length of stay (LOS) in a large emergency department by 30%</li>
                                            <li>Reduced the number of patients who left without being seen (LWOBS) by 60% in the same hospital</li>
                                            <li>Increased customer (patient) satisfaction increased by 73%</li>
                                            <li>Reduced operating room changeover time, which increased the number of surgical procedures performed by 20%.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>The guide, which grew out of a Michigan Hospital Health and Hospital Association learning collaborative including 70 hospital emergency departments, teaches healthcare how to engage staff members at all levels of the organization in team based problem solving that produces and sustains results. The guide outlines chapter by chapter the steps for:</p>
                                        <ul class="disc">
                                            <li>Selecting and scoping a VSI project linked to real organizational, financial and/or clinical issues</li>
                                            <li>Using the value stream mapping tool to create a shared understanding of how the value stream currently works, how well it works and how it might be improved through a redesign using key lean principles</li>

                                        <p>The guide also includes numerous graphics to illustrate the application of the VSI method in a fictional healthcare setting and a glossary of lean terms.</p>

                                        <br>
                                        <p>You cannot implement lean; you have to create it. The same is true for lean and green. In order to create a lean and green business system, there needs to be orchestration across all levels of managing an organisation. There is much more to creating a lean and green business system than just drawing upon a set of tools and techniques.</p>
                                        <p>This book introduces the concept of lean and its impacts on the wider economy. But more importantly, it puts forward a systematic and structured way in which organisations can create a lean and green business system emphasising simple managerial and behavioural changes that often cost nothing or very little, yet deliver significant benefits. The book presents case studies from around the world from leading firms using lean and green as simultaneous sources of inspiration in various sectors of industry—from automotive and retail to textile and brewing. Opportunities are huge, for example, a multi-national food manufacturer saved the equivalent of $1.2 million in water and energy consumption following a one-week blitz intervention in one of their most modern sites in South East Asia.</p>
                                        <p>The following demonstrates various aspects of creating a lean and green enterprise: strategy deployment, process management, supply chain collaboration, and leadership and people engagement. We discuss each area of the model through at least one case study: Strategy Deployment (Tesco), Process Management (Toyota), Supply Chain Collaboration (M&amp;S), Leadership and Engagement (Adnams).</p>
                                        <p>The book shows that the starting point for creating a lean and green business system is the mind-set of senior managers. It is hard to deliver the type of results we have seen from leading edge organisations such as Toyota, Unilever, Tesco, M&amp;S and Adnams without executive commitment to integrating these two approaches to achieve the dual benefit of improved economic and environmental performance.</p>
                                        <p>A starting point is the understanding that there is no trade-off between lean and green, that lean and green should be brought together, as Toyota have done with their Monozukuri approach which is explained in the book. The next step is to create a whole business approach that focuses on the needs of customers, the business, the employees and wider society. In achieving this integration, there is a great deal we can learn from the paradigm shift that occurred during the 1960’s and 1970’s across the Western world as managers came to realize that there was no trade-off between quality and cost. This requires a coherent strategy that is well developed and well deployed across all levels of the business. It also requires that continuous improvement be seen to be about the reduction of not just the classic economic wastes but also environmental wastes such as pollutants, landfill and excess energy and resource usage. This will mean bringing lean people together with environmental teams in a common function and improvement process.</p>

                                        <p>Reaching America's true potential to deliver and receive exceptional health care will require not only an immense and concerted effort, but a fundamental change of perspective from medical providers, government officials, industry leaders, and patients alike. The Institute of Medicine set forth six primary "aims" to which every participant in the American healthcare system must contribute: health care must be safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient centered. Presented as the acronym STEEEP®, the collective realization of these goals is to reduce the burden of illness, injury, and disability in our nation.

                                        <h4>Lean RFS (Repetitive Flexible Supply): putting the pieces together</h4>
                                        <h6>Ian Glenday &amp; Rick Sather</h6>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>The concepts of Lean RFS fly in the face of conventional supply chain planning. It is counter-intuitive on how one improves business performance. The reason being it requires manufacturing to make in ever smaller batches with correspondingly more change-overs – something most people believe would result in reduced efficiencies and increased waste. This was particularly true at Kimberly-Clark (KC) – part of the paper industry – whose factories have very large production equipment based on achieving “economies of scale” = big batches and few change-overs.</p>
                                        <p>Despite this perception, in many companies Lean RFS has created significant changes in the way things are done and delivered quantified improvements. Firstly by removing much of the fire fighting that is endemic in most companies. Secondly in changing people’s mind set about how things can be within companies – greater teamwork and engagement of people coupled with more available time – as a direct result of reducing the fire fighting - to be able to work on improvements. Thirdly it creates a phenomenon called “economies of repetition” which leads to a situation where learning curve, routines and stability can thrive. People like routines, they find the reduction in fire fighting motivating and the stability enables them to continuously make step by step improvements. This leads to increases in performance of efficiency, product quality and waste. It is a foundation on which continuous improvement activities can be built right across the wider supply chain. It is the same concept as what Toyota originally called patterned production or heijunka – the foundation of the Toyota Production System (TPS). However it is also the least understood aspect of TPS and Lean.</p>
                                        <p>Kimberly-Clark has been working with Lean RFS since 2006. They have seen some great results. The workbook is NOT about the Lean RFS journey at KC however it does include many examples, quantified results and lessons learnt from them. KC is a company most people are aware of as a global producer of branded well known consumer products. The book also includes examples, results and lessons learnt from other companies who have implemented Lean RFS.</p>
                                        <p>The imagery of the workbook is a jigsaw puzzle, hence the title “Putting the pieces together”. The analogy is when building a puzzle one first puts in the corner pieces followed by the straight edges to give the puzzle shape, size and points of reference before finally putting in the centre pieces. In many companies Lean is only about what the authors see as the centre pieces – the tools of Lean such as 5S, SMED and kanbans to name a few. There is no foundation, structure and defined shape making sustainable continuous improvement not impossible, but rather difficult, to achieve. First one has to stop the fire fighting endemic in most companies by moving from batch to flow logic = the corner pieces. Then put in the straight edges such as policy deployment and Lean leadership that provide a defined structure. Finally one adds in the centre pieces – the tools and techniques.</p>
                                        <p>This workbook shows – using examples from named companies - how Lean RFS can make a paradigm shift happen.  Lean RFS provides the foundation that makes other improvement techniques and tools easier to implement and sustain leading to a step change in performance. It is NOT a history of applying RFS in KC – it is about how to put the pieces together in the right way if you want to make the paradigm shift of batch to flow logic – using examples from KC and other companies Ian has been working with. To show how they have used the stability, foundation and structure Lean that RFS creates to help them achieve a Lean transformation.</p>

                                        <h6>Katherine Radeka</h6>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>When companies say that they use Lean ideas in product development, what are they doing? What practices and tools have they adopted? How has their product development process changed from their efforts? What results have they seen?</p>
                                        <p>In 2010, Katherine Radeka launched the Lean Product Development Benchmarking Study to answer these questions. All of the 69 companies who responded were eager to share what they had learned in a series of telephone interviews. In 2011, Katherine visited more than two dozen of these companies in a series of benchmarking visits.</p>
                                        <p>Although Eric Rebentisch of MIT, Durward Sobek (Shingo prize winner) and Goran Gustafsson of Chalmers University advised Katherine as she designed the study, it was never intended to be an academic research project. Instead, Katherine's observations and conclusions were meant to provide ideas and inspiration by sharing stories of success with Lean Product Development.</p>
                                        <p>The Mastery of Innovation shares Katherine's conclusions from these observations. The focus of the book is the set of nineteen case studies describing the many ways that companies have used Lean Product Development and the improvements they have seen in their product development performance. In order to be a case study, the company had to have evidence of sustained results.</p>
                                        <p>The contributor companies include Ford, Scania, Novo Nordisk, DJO, Irwin Seating, Philips Electronics, Steelcase and smaller companies that have seen great results from their work with lean. The case studies reflect the breadth of the lean community, with industry representation, geographic location, company structure and size.</p>
                                        <p>The main message from these case studies is that there is no one best way to implement Lean in product development. Each successful implementation of lean product development was significantly different. Some chose to focus on Value Stream Mapping and others on Knowledge Creation and Reuse to eliminate the waste of reinvention. Some used A3 Reports and Visual Planning Boards- others used electronic tools. Every company had adapted Lean to fit.</p>
                                        <p>These companies serve as exemplars and inspiration for people considering Lean Product Development. They demonstrate that the Lean Product Development theory works in practice, giving product development leaders the confidence to bring Lean into the lab.</p>
                                        <p>In the rest of the book, Katherine shares some basic information about lean in product development and the consolidated observations from all 69 companies. The final chapter lays out a framework for the phases of a Lean Product Development Transformation.</p>

                                        <p>Building a lean problem-solving culture begins and ends with people and leadership. While many books teach about lean tools, few address the day-to-day leadership requirements of successfully transforming organizations into the lean enterprise. In 15 easy-to-read-and-reference chapters, People: A leader's day-to-day guide to building, managing, and sustaining lean organizations, outlines the high-level concepts, activities, principles, and practices that a lean leader must know intimately and apply daily. This book was written with the sole purpose of fundamentally changing how you think and act relative to leadership.</p>
                                        <p>A lean leader is an educator, trainer, coach, and mentor. The lean leader is always planning, sharing the plan, and executing the plan based on deep knowledge of his team members' personalities, skills, and how the game is played. As a student and teacher, the lean leader understands the value of people. We love the game, and the people who play it.</p>

                                        <br>
                                        <p><em>Healthcare Kaizen</em> focuses on the principles and methods of daily, or Kaizen, for healthcare professionals and organizations. Kaizen is a Japanese word that means “change for the better,” as introduced to the West by Masaaki Imai in his 1986 book Kaizen: the Key to Japan’s Competitive Success and through the books of Norman Bodek, both of whom contributed introductory material for the book. In 1989, Dr. Donald M. Berwick, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, endorsed the principles of Kaizen in the New England Journal of Medicine, describing it as “the continuous search for opportunities for all processes to get better.” This book shows how to make this goal a reality.</p>
                                        <p><em>Healthcare Kaizen</em> shares some of the methods used by numerous hospitals around the world, including Franciscan St. Francis Health, where co-author Joe Swartz has led these efforts. Most importantly, the book covers the management mindsets and philosophies required to make Kaizen work effectively in a hospital department or as an organization-wide program.</p>
                                        <p><em>Healthcare Kaizen</em> shares examples and of actual Kaizen improvements from different healthcare organizations, from various departments in inpatient and outpatient settings and is unique in highlighting process improvement activities conducted by physicians, nurses and other clinicians. The book includes a total of 200 full-color pictures and visual illustrations of Kaizen-based improvements that were initiated by nurses, physicians, medical technologists, pharmacists, housekeepers, senior executives and other staff members at all levels.</p>
                                        <p><em>Healthcare Kaizen</em> will be helpful for organizations that have embraced weeklong improvement events, but now want to follow the lead of ThedaCare, Virginia Mason Medical Center, and others who have moved beyond just doing events into a more complete improvement methodology management system based on Lean or the Toyota Production System.</p>
                                        <p>It’s often said, without much reflection, that “people hate change.” The experiences shared in this book prove that people actually love change when they are fully engaged in the process, get to make improvements that improve patient care and make their day less frustrating, and when they don’t fear being laid off as a result of their improvements.</p>

                                        <p>Most business readers have heard of the Lean principles developed for factories—a set of tools and ideas that have enabled companies to dramatically boost quality by reducing waste and errors—producing more while using less. Yet until now, few have recognized how relevant these powerful ideas are to individuals and their daily work. Every person at a desk, drafting table, workstation, or operating table must (like a factory) deal with the challenge of reducing the waste that creeps into their work. The same Lean principles that have improved efficiencies on the factory floor can be just as powerful—in fact, far more so—in helping individuals boost personal performance.</p>
                                        <p><em>A Factory of One: Applying Lean Principles to Banish Waste and Improve Your Personal Performance</em> describes how you can foster a new mindset and improve your performance by applying Lean methods to your work. It translates powerful Lean tools such as visual management, flow, pull, 5S, and kaizen to your daily work, revealing how they can help to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and link you ever more closely to customer value. This practice will help you develop better self-awareness, more disciplined problem-solving skills, and the ability to self-correct errors.</p>
                                        <p>This book not only provides the tools, but also teaches you how to find the root causes underlying your inefficiencies so you can eliminate them permanently. It will enable you to immediately improve personal productivity while developing the skills needed for continuous improvement. It includes real-world examples that illustrate how these principles have been successfully applied across a range of industries. Providing the perfect mix of what-to-do with why-to-do it, the text details a step-by-step approach to applying Lean principles to your work.</p>

                                        <p>Leaders of lean-thinking organizations require some unique, even contradictory traits. They must be servants as well as trailblazers, good listeners and mentors as well as visionaries and team players. While traditional companies might be able to get by with old-fashioned, command-and-control managers, lean organizations need the talents, enthusiasm, and opinions of every person. This means that leaders must serve the people and the processes while guiding everyone toward fulfilling the organization’s true purpose. It is a tall order and, in many ways, a new definition of leadership.</p>
                                        <p>For 30 years, Jerry Bussell studied leadership while bringing lean practices to companies such as Medtronic and becoming a passionate, well-known advocate for lean. In that time, he saw many lean initiatives fail through lack of leadership or repeated missteps by those in charge. Realizing that leaders rarely understood the needs of an organization that is becoming highly efficient, self-motivated and improvement driven, he set out to help. In a lean environment, after all, true leadership is not a nicety; it is a necessity.</p>
                                        <p>In this book, Jerry identifies the ten essential characteristics of a lean leader and illustrates those traits with stories from modern CEOs and one of this country’s greatest leaders, President Abraham Lincoln. Whether you are a CEO or running your first kaizenevent, this book will keep you engaged and help you focus on the behaviors and attitudes that are essential to creating the kind of continuous open-loop improvement that is the heart of lean thinking.</p>

                                        <p>The ability to implement and maintain improvement initiatives like Lean and Six Sigma is essential for improving quality, eliminating waste, reducing costs, and increasing output—but it’s only the first step. Eventually, the improve-sustain-improve-sustain pattern itself becomes the end product. But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
                                        <p>Why make operational improvement a perpetual process when you can make <em>business growth</em> a perpetual process?</p>
                                        <p>In this trailblazing book, Kevin Duggan—author of <em>Creating Mixed Model Value Streams</em> and founder of the Institute for Operational Excellence and Duggan Associates—takes you beyond Lean and Six Sigma to achieve true Operational Excellence. By developing a “design for operational excellence” you can leverage the operations side of the business to enable continuous growth.</p>
                                        <p><em>Design for Operational Excellence</em> provides the design criteria and guidelines that enable you to grow your business organically by refocusing management’s attention from running the business to growing the business. Duggan takes you step by step through the new principles of Operational Excellence:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Design Lean Value Streams</li>
                                            <li>Make Lean Value Streams Flow</li>
                                            <li>Make Flow Visual</li>
                                            <li>Create Standard Work for Flow</li>
                                            <li>Make Abnormal Flow Visual</li>
                                            <li>Create Standard Work for Abnormal Flow</li>
                                            <li>Have Employees in the Flow Improve the Flow</li>
                                            <li>Perform Offense Activities</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Case studies illustrate how companies that applied Duggan’s methods grew consistently over time by designing and implementing a lean flow of product to the customer. The result was a flow that “self healed” when interruptions occurred, which removed the need to manage flow. These methods work in any business environment, not just manufacturing. Everything from insurance, financial, and banking organizations to hospitals, mining companies, universities, and even government can benefit from the bottom-line and topline business results Duggan’s methodology offers.</p>
                                        <p><em>Design for Operational Excellence</em> is the next great leap in the evolution of sustained business growth. Begin designing for growth now and stop reacting to customer needs. Instead, position your operation to provide customer solutions in changing markets, which will lead to profit and growth in even the most severe economic and market downturns.</p>

                                        <p>This book develops a new model for lean management. The intent is to demonstrate a model framework consisting of four critical components: leadership, culture, team and tools. The development of the model and these four components will be built from empirical theories reported in the research literature and in successful applications. This framework will offer a path to develop lean leaders with practical, actionable guidelines. The model framework is suited to broad applications offering practical guidelines for manufacturing and service environments alike. The lean model will develop each of these four components, explaining their relevance and importance for guiding internal lean initiatives. In developing the model, the text will chronicle the historical development of lean noting the significant lean contributions, contributors, and dates of these contributions. This development will trace contributions to the practice of lean back hundreds of years, prior to the contributions of Henry Ford and the contributors from the Toyota system in the 1950's. The future of Lean will also be examined with the current topic of sustainability and how it has extended lean concepts with an external focus towards product life cycle concerns and social issues. This offering is different from competing offerings in three fundamental ways. First, it offers and develops of a comprehensive lean model based on a sound framework. Second, it examines a comprehensive timeline of significant lean contributions and their contributors. Third, it extends lean by looking at the future applications in the area of sustainability.</p>

                                        <p><em>Lean Done Right: Achieve and Maintain Reform in Your Healthcare Organization</em> provides a roadmap for launching a transformative and sustainable Lean initiative. The Lean implementation model focuses on strategically directed action, developing a lean organizational culture, and enhancing the care delivery system.</p>

                                        <p>Instead of building new hospitals that import old systems and problems, the time has come to reexamine many of our ideas about what a hospital should be. Can a building foster continuous improvement? How can we design it to be flexible and useful well into the future? How can we do more with less?</p>
                                        <p>Answering these questions and more, Lean-Led Hospital Design: Creating the Efficient Hospital of the Future explains how hospitals can be built to increase patient safety and reduce wait times while eliminating waste, lowering costs, and easing some of healthcare’s most persistent problems. It supplies a simplified timeline of architectural planning—from start to finish—to guide readers through the various stages of the Lean design development philosophy, including Lean architectural design and Lean work design. It includes examples from several real healthcare facility design and construction projects, as well as interviews with hospital leaders and architects.</p>

                                        <p>The Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance defines safety as the maintenance of peace of mind. Without peace of mind, or the serenity brought about by a safe working environment, employees will be unwilling and even unable to focus their energies on production improvement. Thus, it can be said that all improvement begins with safety.</p>
                                        <p>A how-to manual on the proper integration of safety and environmental sustainability with Lean implementations, <em>Lean Sustainability: Creating Safe, Enduring, and Profitable Operations</em> provides a proven recipe for achieving safety and sustainability excellence. This book is the result of the author’s two decades of experience implementing Lean; Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE); and sustainability processes in the chemical, food, and consumer products industries. It unveils valuable lessons learned and little-known tips for eliminating waste and increasing process efficiency—while reducing safety incidents and the overall impact on the environment.</p>

                                        <p>“Own The Gap” exposes many of the conventional myths of leading a lean transformation and explores the intersection between strategy, improvements, and results. Written and researched over the past year, the book includes detailed information on how to create a strategy deployment process which defines what it means to win at each level of the organization. In addition to building an effective strategy deployment process, the book includes examples of how to build a visual management system that enables teams to see if they are winning or losing in real time. After a team can see whether or not they are winning, the book shows you how to develop a daily kaizen cycle, where problem solving, employee suggestions, and recognition systems occur across every team, every day. Finally, the role of leaders in creating, improving and sustaining these systems is provided. The book includes step by step instruction on how to create leader standard work,engage follow up through reaction protocol, and drive results with daily huddles, weekly action plan reviews and a monthly step back process.</p>

                                        <p>Machines need to be productive. People need to be effective. Productivity books focus on doing more, Jim and Tonianne want you to focus on doing better. Personal Kanban is about choosing the right work at the right time. Recognizing why we do the things we do. Understanding the impact of our actions. Creating value - not just product. For ourselves, our families, our friends, our co-workers. For our legacy. Personal Kanban takes the same Lean principles from manufacturing that led the Japanese auto industry to become a global leader in quality, and applies them to individual and team work. Personal Kanban asks only that we visualize our work and limit our work-in-progress. Visualizing work allows us to transform our conceptual and threatening workload into an actionable, context-sensitive flow. Limiting our work-in-progress helps us complete what we start and understand the value of our choices. Combined, these two simple acts encourage us to improve the way we work and the way we make choices to balance our personal, professional, and social lives. Neither a prescription nor a plan, Personal Kanban provides a light, actionable, achievable framework for understanding our work and its context. This book describes why students, parents, business leaders, major corporations, and world governments all see immediate results with Personal Kanban.</p>

                                        <p>This radical second book by healthcare executive John Toussaint, MD, outlines the essential framework for curing America's healthcare system from inflated costs and poor quality. The current state of healthcare in this country cannot be sustained and requires potent medicine. While health systems have made great strides toward increasing quality and reducing medical harm in isolation, they often struggle against a system that actually rewards waste and error. In Toussaint's hard-charging debut, On the Mend, readers were introduced to the efforts of ThedaCare, a five-hospital system in northeastern Wisconsin in redesigning care delivery by building a culture of continuous improvement. This resulted in some of the best healthcare quality and lowest costs in the United States. But delivery is only one side of the game. Potent Medicine introduces two additional key components in creating a value-based healthcare system in America: paying providers based on outcomes and making healthcare quality and cost data transparent. The book reveals eye-opening accounts from the physicians and system leaders who stood on the frontlines during the development of Wisconsin's most innovative healthcare organizations, and from the patients they're trying to help. Change is bearing down fast on U.S. healthcare. Potent Medicine shares the insights and tools that leaders need to not only anticipate and adapt to that change, but to drive it. The book is a call to action for all stakeholders to collaborate: physicians, consumers, insurers, employers, healthcare leaders, and policy makers across the nation to join together and participate in ongoing experiments to transform our nation's healthcare system. Read about the proven methods that will get us to higher quality and better value in healthcare.</p>

                                        <h6>Dr. Sami Bahri &amp; Bruce Hamilton</h6>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>Meet Dr. Sami Bahri, the “World’s First Lean Dentist.” Over the past thirty years, through personal study of The Deming Management System and subsequently many texts describing the Toyota Production System, Dr. Bahri and his staff have continuously pursued a singular mission: “to provide patients with the correct treatment they need, when they need it, in the right quantity that they need it, while eliminating anything that interrupts or delays this flow.”</p>
                                        <p>Borrowing the Toyota concept of one-by-one production, Dr. Bahri and his team refer to their vision as “single patient flow.” Don’t make the patient wait – anywhere. This single-minded goal has been the compass for many small improvements including a pull system to manage a flow of material, information and treatment to the patient. Quick change instrument trays assure that most dental procedures can be completed at a single seating. Visual controls alert a thoroughly cross-trained staff of dental assistants, hygienists, front office specialists and dentists when help is needed. Daily improvement and problem-solving occur through morning meetings and on-the-spot adjustments.</p>
                                        <p>Behind the tools is an enduring respect for employees and patients. In Dr.Bahri’s words, “It’s a win-win for the patient who competes his treatment in fewer visits and the practice which now has nearly twice as many available hours to see patients.” But the journey is never-ending as you’ll hear from Dr. Bahri, his staff and even his customers.</p>

                                        <p>The biggest competitive advantage an organization can achieve comes from the synergies created by employees skilled in enhancing organizational dynamics. The Seven Kata: Toyota Kata, TWI, and Lean Training supplies time-tested tools and advice to help readers adapt to changing conditions and outcompete their rivals. It explains why a mix of the skill sets that Training Within Industry (TWI) and the Toyota Kata (behavior patterns) teach is the ideal recipe to boost organizational synergies and enhance any Lean transformation.</p>
                                        <p>Bridging the kata/TWI nexus, the book lays out a road map for Lean success. It devotes a chapter to each of the Seven Kata and suggests possible courses of action dependent on your organization’s strengths and constraints. Bringing together valuable information on many of the disjointed Lean practices, it explains key Lean concepts, including gemba walks, genchi gembutsu, and PDCA.</p>
                                        <p>After introducing kata, it reveals the different kata inherent in the three major TWI courses and the TWI Job Safety course. It illustrates the value stream analysis relationship to the kata and the kata relationship to TWI. It also demonstrates how to use kata to solve the problems identified in your value stream analysis while simultaneously conditioning your employees’ adaptive thinking patterns.</p>
                                        <p>Supplying a clear understanding of exactly where the seven kata apply in your Lean journey, the authors include helpful guidelines for coaching a kata. They also highlight mistakes they have experienced or witnessed so you can avoid the same pitfalls. As globalism continues to make management’s organizational skills a competitive differentiator, this book provides you with the tools to use the seven kata to place your organization on a discernible path towards operational excellence.</p>

                                        <p>The recession upset a record period of global growth and expansion, forcing entire industries to rethink their business model. To ensure continued market share and profitability, many organizations are deploying Lean and Six Sigma efforts directed at key cost, quality and service objectives in order to maximize customer value and reduce cost. And many will fail at meeting those objectives. After two decades in the trenches of helping companies design and build better, more efficient operations, Karen Martin has pinpointed why performance improvement programs often fail: chaos, the sneaky but powerful force that frustrates customers, keeps business leaders awake at night, and saps company morale.</p>
                                        <p>In <em>The Outstanding Organization: Generate Business Results by Eliminating Chaos and Building the Foundation for Everyday Excellence</em>, Karen offers a toolbox for combating chaos by creating the organizational conditions that will allow your improvement efforts to return greater gains. Proven, practical, and surprisingly simple, Karen’s system focuses on four key behaviors for operational excellence—Clarity, Focus, Discipline, Engagement—that, once instilled into a company’s DNA, open the door to sustainable growth and profit.</p>

                                        <p>America’s healthcare system needs to change. Not only does our country spend 16 percent of its gross domestic product on healthcare, but despite spending more than other industrialized countries, our general health lags behind. While we have plenty of data identifying where healthcare in America falls short, we’ve precious little practical, hands-on information about how to fix it.</p>
                                        <p>In <em>The Pittsburgh Way to Efficient Healthcare</em>, Naida Grunden provides a ingenious and optimistic look at how principles borrowed from industry can be applied to make healthcare safer, and in doing so, make it more effective and less costly. The book is a compilation of case studies from units in different hospitals around the Pittsburgh region that successfully applied industrial principles to the benefit of patients and the satisfaction of employees.</p>
                                        <p><em>The Pittsburgh Way to Efficient Healthcare</em> is written for all healthcare stakeholders – from clinicians to insurers to employers to those who have the greatest stake in healthcare quality improvement, the patients.</p>

                                        <p>Fear of change—we all experience it. Some accept change immediately, some gradually adapt, while others may never get there. Whether it’s poor leadership, the inability to change, or pure ego, this book explores this perplexing commitment to inefficiency. The Psychology of Lean Improvements: Why Organizations Must Overcome Resistance and Change the Culture examines the psychology behind why businesses avoid Lean transformations. It investigates why businesses cling to the eight deadly wastes and why they still find ways to place continuous improvement on the back burner.</p>
                                        <p>Frequently sought out for his expertise in Lean manufacturing, Chris Ortiz has been featured in a number of trade publications and on the television show Inside Business with Fred Thompson. In this book, Mr. Ortiz breaks down the fear of change within executives and organizational leaders. He examines the psychology of dysfunction, provides insight into why so many businesses fall short in creating visions for growth and prosperity, and identifies tools that can help you address resistance to change.</p>
                                        <p>Detailing implementation techniques with a proven track record for success, the book considers specific strategies that can be helpful towards improving your company and changing its culture—including cellular manufacturing, total productive maintenance, setup reduction, Kanban, visual communication, and in-line production. It explains how to get started on your Lean transformation, describes why an economic downturn might be a good time to embrace Lean, and warns of the dangers behind failing to do so.</p>

                                        <p><em>Building a Lean Fulfillment Stream</em> will change the way you think about your supply chain and logistics networks.  Even better - it gives you a way to act using lean principles to transform and continuously improve these two key flows.</p>
                                        <p>In this pioneering workbook, lean logistics veterans Robert Martichenko and Kevin von Grabe explain step-by-step a comprehensive, real-life implementation process for optimizing your entire fulfillment stream from raw materials to customers, including practical insights into two critical concepts: calculating the total cost of fulfillment and collaborating across all functions and firms along the fulfillment stream.</p>
                                        <p>Your company, like most, probably calculates costs at different points within departments, such as the piece price paid by the purchasing department to a supplier. Few companies figure the total cost associated with each major function across the whole fulfillment stream. Calculating total cost, which most executives find surprisingly large, lets you measure the impact of your improvement efforts on operational performance and overall income.</p>
                                        <p>Martichenko and von Grabe also give you guidance and tools for collaboration. Using the example company ABE Corp. as their model, the authors illustrate how the lean conversion process is a win-win for every company along the supply chain. And an accompanying analysis illustrates the financial benefits and shows you how to apply the metrics.</p>
                                        <p>The narrative, supported by 41 charts and illustrations, including value-stream maps, shows you:</p>

                                        <p><em>Lean Office and Service Simplified</em> goes beyond the basic tools and delves into the key concepts of Lean as they apply to office and services. Value Stream Management will be discussed first, followed by chapters on Standard Work, Flow, Level Pull and Visual Management. Further, each will be explored in tremendous depth and will provide a step-by-step methodology for each. Chapter 6 will cover several of the more important "tools" such as 5S and Mistake Proofing. These should be applied while implementing the key concepts covered in Chapters 1 through 5 in order to maximize the benefits.</p>
                                        <p>Chapter 7 provides a function by function review of the application of lean. Does lean apply to Sales and Marketing? How about Finance and Accounting? These are frequently asked questions that need responses. Functions commonly found in most all service organizations and the administrative areas of manufacturing companies are covered. It must be noted that the examples provided in this chapter must be implemented in the context of Value Stream Management in order to maximize the benefits.</p>
                                        <p>While the common sense nature of lean concepts will resonate with most people, the successful application of lean requires fundamental behavioral change in many people. People are creatures of habit, and therefore, will have difficulty changing. However, they can create new habits if sufficient time is allowed. The most common obstacles encountered will be addressed throughout the book, along with strategies to overcome them drawing on over twenty years of practical experience. This discussion will culminate in Chapter 8 "Leading the Lean Organization". The hope is that the reader will come away with the confidence to put into practice the well tested and proven methodologies provided.</p>

                                        <p>The paper “Lean principles, learning, and knowledge work: Evidence from a software services provider” examines the applicability of lean production to knowledge work by investigating the implementation of a lean production system at an Indian software services firm. Authors, Staats, Brunner, and Upton, first discuss specific aspects of knowledge work – task uncertainty, process invisibility, and architectural ambiguity – that call into question the relevance of lean production in this setting. Then, combining a detailed case study and empirical analysis, the authors find that lean software projects perform better than non-lean software projects at the company for most performance outcomes. The article documents the influence of the lean initiative on internal processes and examines how the techniques affect learning by improving both problem identification and problem resolution. Finally, the authors extend the lean production framework by highlighting the need to 1) identify problems early in the process and 2) keep problems and solution together in time, space, and person.</p>

                                        <p>While Lean practices have been successfully implemented into the process industry with excellent results for over 20 years (including the author’s own award winning example at Exxon Chemical), that industry has been especially slow in adopting Lean. Part of the problem is that the process industry needs its own version of Lean. The larger part of the problem is resistance to transformational change, a barrier that can only be overcome with effective leadership and results-oriented planning that engages rather than excludes all stakeholders.</p>
                                        <p>Written by Raymond Floyd, an unparalleled leader of Lean transformations, Liquid Lean: Developing Lean Culture in the Process Industries provides potential process industry change agents with the no-nonsense guide needed to eliminate waste and achieve sustainable optimal efficiency.  Presenting lessons in lean as they apply within the liquid industries, the book focuses on developing the four measures of Lean as defined by the Shingo Award:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Business Results</li>
                                            <li>Consistent Lean Enterprise Culture</li>

                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Illustrated with his own success stories, Floyd describes business results, Lean enterprise thinking, and policy deployment in process industry terms. He offers detailed theory, practice, and examples of continuous process improvement, and describes the leadership and defines the ethics needed to evolve and sustain Lean transformation. Floyd lays out the specific steps needed during the first six months of transformation and the benchmarks to be achieved during the first two years of implementation. All companies can benefit from Lean; this book makes sure that those who want it, know how.</p>

                                    <p>In <em>On the Mend: Revolutionizing Healthcare to Save Lives and Transform the Industry</em> John Toussaint, MD, former CEO of ThedaCare, and Roger A. Gerard, PhD, its chief learning officer, candidly describe the triumphs and stumbles of a seven-year journey to lean healthcare, an effort that continues today and that has slashed medical errors, improved patient outcomes, raised staff morale, and saved $27 million dollars in costs without layoffs.</p>

                                        <p>This work has an extremely widespread application as the tools, techniques, and methods described are at a level that achieves the goals of Lean and operational excellence without tying them down to a specific industry or work stream. The book provides practical knowledge for lean champions, managers, and executives driving toward operational excellence enterprise-wide. The story format, and the presentation of this material was excellent, and the avoidance of lean and operational excellence jargon gives the book a wide appeal…it is a pleasure to read.</p>
                                        <p>The Remedy is a compelling a business fable that shows how Lean quality improvement business practices—traditionally associated with manufacturing--can dramatically improve the service areas of your business-including design, engineering, sales, marketing and all processes in between.</p>
                                        <p>Written by Pascal Dennis, a leading Lean consultant, the story follows Tom Pappas and Rachel Armstrong, senior leaders at a desperate automotive company as they try to implement a Lean management system across an entire platform, the Chloe, a breakthrough "green" car. The future of the company is at stake. Can Tom and Rachel, supported by Andy Saito, a retired, reclusive Toyota executive, regain the trust and respect of the customer? Can a venerable but dying company implement Lean practices to every part of their business and learn a new, more effective way of managing?</p>

                                        <p>The large majority of organizations that have embarked on an operational excellence program through lean, six sigma, or lean six-sigma, have found the results at first positive, then reaching a plateau, and then going in reverse.   The Shingo Prize committee found that was true of too many of the past award winners.  They concluded the difference between those who sustained the journey to excellence and those who did not was leadership and culture.  This prompted revising the award to focus more intensely on leadership and culture, rather than just the tools.</p>
                                        <p>This book complements those efforts by providing a thorough treatment of the philosophy, thinking, and methods of a true culture of continuous improvement, and provides case examples of the journey.  The Toyota Way was never a process improvement methodology, but rather focuses on a long-term quest for excellence based on creating a system of processes that reveal problems so highly developed people with finally honed problem solving skills can continually improve whatever they are responsible for.  This culture of continuous improvement provides an army of process improvement experts in every part of the company who are then aligned through a shared company vision.   Separating out “lean processes” as a standalone endeavor does not make sense for any organization, and, in fact, treating lean and six sigma like a technical toolkit to fix processes is why most companies fail to achieve true operational excellence. </p>
                                        <p>This book is the result of decades of practice trying to help companies on their journeys.  We start with some theory, focusing in what makes anybody excellent in anything (a sport, music, cooking, engineering), which is a disciplined process of deep practice with teachers providing immediate feedback and guidance. We then draw on what Dr. Deming taught Toyota about becoming excellent which is to practice diligently Plan-Do-Check-Adjust (PDCA) at all levels of the company all the time.  We illustrate attempts to use this philosophy of teaching companies how to learn through case examples either we or our associates have led in diverse industries including manufacturing heavy equipment, iron ore mining, developing fuel for nuclear power plants, designing next generation automotive systems, running millions of blood and tissue tests in a healthcare lab, running a long-term care facility, and more.  Throughout the book we have sensei (teacher) reflections from our guest sensei who led the transformations. We humbly (because we have failed as often as we have succeeded) end with what we have learned about what works, and doesn’t, in attempting this ambitious transformation toward a culture of striving for excellence.   The conclusion discusses practical issues like where to start, the role of the sensei and the coach, how to expand the learning process, the role of leadership, and how to address the many barriers to progressing on the journey.</p>

                                        <p>Since <em>The Machine that Changed the World</em> (1991) defined “lean production” (based on the model of the Toyota Production System) as the next new paradigm of management since the mass production revolution, lean has spread from automotive, to the rest of industry globally, to defense, to financial services, to government, to health care, and more.  As it expanded globally we have learned a great deal, both about what lean really means within Toyota, and about factors that lead to success and failure in trying to bring it to other organizations.  At a high level we can view the evolution from lean as a toolkit to eliminate waste, to lean as system to deliver customer value, to lean as a philosophy of continuous improvement, and now we are moving into a new era.  Lean, aka continuous improvement, is being recognized as a deep corporate philosophy that must be reinforced daily by leadership at all levels of the organization.  It is a way to connect operational excellence to a company’s business strategy, but this can only be achieved if both deep and broad in the organization team members are constantly surfacing problems, finding the root cause (Plan), attempting countermeasures (Do), checking what happened, and acting on what they learned (PDCA).</p>
                                        <p>The role of leadership in a lean organization, as detailed in <em>The Toyota Way to Lean Leadership</em>, is to live the values, show the way, and develop others through daily coaching.  Organizations are increasingly discovering the role of culture and leadership.  Unfortunately, there is no quick-fix recipe to transform leaders from a short-term focus on quarterly returns to a long-term focus on developing people to achieve operational excellence.  The typical leader in the typical organization is almost 180 degrees away from a model of lean leadership.  Changing values and leadership behavior is every bit as challenging as trying to convince overweight people to change their lifestyle to healthy eating and regular exercise.  They must want it badly and transform themselves.  Leaders that succeed in changing themselves to lead, teach, and coach on the long-term journey to continuous improvement throughout the organization will change the game in their industry.</p>
                                        <p>In this book we define a model of lean leadership based on Gary’s 25 years of experience with NUMMI, Toyota, and then as CEO of Dana and Jeff’s 30 years of deep study of Toyota.  We explain the model through stories from our collective experiences and give practical advice for the long hard road leaders must commit to in order to truly self develop.</p>

                                        <p>The Virginia Mason Productions System is based on the Toyota Production System, a manufacturing approach Toyota has used for more than 50 years.  Like Toyota, Virginia Mason’s experience is truly a journey in continuous improvement.  This book represents a snapshot in time describing Virginia Mason’s place on that path.  Applying the manufacturing methodology to health care is difficult and, by its nature, evolves on a daily basis.  Today, a visitor to Virginia Mason may see processes or work flows that are different than what is described in this book.  Some improvements, in fact, have not been spread to all corners of the organization.  Other improvements may not have been sustained simply because change is hard, and it takes people to ensure it is maintained.  However, through a culture characterized by the rigorous and consistent application of the tools and methods of VMPS, all processes and work flows ultimately will be more efficient, resulting in higher quality care and improved patient safety.</p>

                                        <p>Jeffrey Liker, the world's leading expert on Toyota processes and culture, was granted unprecedented access to the company's systems and people.

                                        <p>In the tradition of Taoist philosophers and Zen masters, Steve Hoeft tells the stories he learned from his Toyota Production System (TPS) master teachers. Sometimes enigmatic, sometimes funny, but always powerful and enlightening, these stories of continuous improvement and Lean implementation are organized around the Toyota House framework. After covering historical and foundational aspects of TPS, the stories go on to illustrate a wealth of essential topics encompassing the timeless, unchanging principles of Just-In-Time, Built in Quality, and Respect for People, and delves into specifics on many tools like kanban, Quick Changeover, and A3 Problem Solving.</p>
                                        <p>More than entertainment, the telling of stories is a way that human wisdom is handed from one generation to the next. It is a gentle but memorable way to learn the lessons of failure without suffering the personal pain of misdirected efforts; a way to find the best path without having to personally experience hundreds of dead-end journeys. It is a way to gain understanding that goes deeper than definitions.</p>

                                        <p><em>Toyota Kata</em> defines management as, “the systematic pursuit of desired conditions by utilizing human capabilities in a concerted way.” Rother proposes that it is not solutions themselves that provide sustained competitive advantage and long-term survival, but the degree to which an organization has mastered an effective routine for developing fitting solutions again and again, along unpredictable paths. This requires teaching the skills behind the solution.</p>
                                        <p>In this management approach a primary job of leaders and managers is to develop people so that desired results can be achieved. They do this by having the organization members (leaders and managers included) deliberately practice a routine, or kata, that develops and channels their creative abilities. Kata are patterns that are practiced so they become second nature, and were originally movement sequences in martial arts.</p>
                                        <p><em>Toyota Kata</em> submits that the improvement-kata pattern of thinking and behavior is universal; applicable not only in business but in education, politics, daily living, etc.. The book’s underlying message is that when people practice and learn a kata for how to proceed through unclear territory, they don't need to fear the obstacles, changes and unknowns they encounter. Rather than trying to hold onto a sense of certainty based on one's perspective, people can derive confidence from a kata for working through uncertainty.</p>

                                        <p>In 2004, GBMP released Toast Kaizen, a short video to demonstrate the importance of direct observation in continuous improvement. It is now used around the world (in 14 languages) to help explain the true meaning of Kaizen. In reality, as viewers observe the 2004 toast-making process, they are witnessing an already improved process, one where much Muda, Mura and Muri have already been remove as the modern-day kitchen is fairly well organized already. But this is not so in most other endeavors.</p>
                                        <p>According to Bruce Hamilton (the Toast Guy), “If our kitchens were organized the same way as our factories, offices and clinics, then the refrigerator would be in basement, the toaster would be in the attic and the bread would be stored anywhere there was an open space. We would be making huge batches of toast that spent most of their existence being moved and stored. And we’d see isolated departments that each added a little bit of value and a whole lot of waste, working out of sync, rarely communicating and often displeasing the customer.. Just like most business environments.”</p>
                                        <p>So, watching "Toast Kaizen", it’s easy to separate the wastes from the work, and in doing so make the whole job easier, better, faster and cheaper. But what if the process is not self-contained as in a kitchen. What if the process is laid out like most factories and offices? Then those material, information and production flows would be spread out all over into functional areas that would hide most of the waste. In fact, almost none of us see the whole process in our daily work, just the little piece we do ourselves. So now, GBMP offers "Toast VSM", a 2009 sequel to the original - a DVD no Lean Training Library should be without.</p>

                                        <p>In his book, <em>Follow the Learner: The Role of a Leader in Creating a Lean Culture</em>, Dr. Sami Bahri describes how he and the staff in his dental practice tackled each of these questions. The book describes how their organization, the Bahri Dental Group, transformed their work and their thinking from a traditional batch-and-queue approach to one focused directly on the needs of the patient, not on the needs of the practitioners. The purpose of Follow the Leader is to present a picture of how any organization can build a culture based on lean principles and tools. Why tell a story about a dental practice? First, everyone has been to the dentist. Every reader has a common frame of reference and therefore has experienced the processes and problems Dr. Bahri describes. Second, he happens to be one of the most dedicated and knowledgeable lean thinkers and practitioners in any field. Follow the Learner provides a glimpse into what it means to become a lean learning organization and a leadership model for continuously improving it. People at all levels of lean experience in any type of organization will be able to read this book and better understand the universal application of both lean methods and leadership practices.</p>

The Lean Manager, the sequel to the Balles' international best-selling business novel The Gold Mine, tells the compelling story of plant manager Andrew Ward as he goes through the challenging but rewarding journey to becoming a lean manager. Ward learns to use a deep understanding of lean tools, as well as a technical know-how of his plant's operations, to foster a lean attitude that sustains continuous improvement. Ward moves beyond fluency with tools to changing his behavior as a manager and leader. He shifts from giving orders and answers to asking the right questions so people identify and address problems. He learns how to use tools to unleash the creativity and motivation of people, so they learn how to solve problems as well as coach and teach others to solve problems. Ward learns how to create lean managers.</p>

                                        <p>Systems Engineering (SE) is regarded as a sound practice but often burdened with waste, as documented in recent NASA, Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Department of Defense (DoD) studies. Lean thinking is the holistic work system credited for the extraordinary rise of Toyota. Lean thinking has been successfully applied in many work fields such as general manufacturing, aerospace. engineering, healthcare, service industries. The emerging field of Lean Systems Engineering (LSE) is the application of lean principles, practices and tools to SE and to the related aspects of enterprise management (EM) in order to enhance the delivery of value (which is defined as flawless delivery of product or mission with satisfaction of all stakeholders) while reducing waste.This paper contains four parts: 1) Historical background of the new field of LSE and a review of the fundamental concepts of Lean Thinking. 2) The development process of a new product called "Lean Enablers for Systems Engineering." 3) A list of the Enablers organized into six Lean principles. 4) Summary and conclusions. The Lean Enablers for Systems Engineering is a comprehensive checklist of 194 non-mandatory practices and recommendations forillulated as "do's" and "don'ts" of SE and containing tacit knowledge (collective wisdom) on how to prepare for, plan, execute, and practice SE and EM using lean thinking.</p>

                                        <p><em>Breaking Through to Flow</em> helps practitioners go beyond the fire-fighting associated with constant change. There is a lot more to lean than simply eliminating waste from current processes. This workbook introduces a new pathway that is helping many organizations overcome this hurdle and launch them on to the next phase of their lean journey – breaking through to flow. The workbook describes how it is possible to move step-by-step toward leveled production and later on to produce in-line with customer demand. Breaking Through to Flow also introduces a tool and management system, called the Glenday Sieve, which enables organizations to quickly create a stable flow and replenishment pull system for the few products that account for a significant part of their output, while managing separately the tail of build-to-order products with low volume and unpredictable demand. This pathway will help people make a fundamental change in their thinking and working that is at the heart of lean – moving from batch to flow logic.</p>
