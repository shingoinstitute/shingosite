                                <br>
                                <p>State Farm Insurance has been using the <em>Shingo Model</em> to transform Life and Health Insurance Operations for more than eight years. The Model has been the platform for dramatic positive change, improving scale and value for their customers while lowering costs. As head of Centralized Operations, Sheila Montney has played a key leadership role throughout this transformation. In manufacturing settings, machines are built before factories open. Ms. Montney will discuss how “machines” were built in a financial services organization that has been in business for more than 90 years. She will then cover the leverage of the Shingo Model to build a sustainable culture of continuous improvement anchored by ideal behaviors at all levels from front-line associates to senior executives. State Farm Life Operations received the Shingo Bronze Medallion in 2012. They were the first financial services organization to be recognized by the Shingo Institute for their efforts.

                                <br>
                                <p>Jorge Perera will share the process Boston Scientific, Costa Rica used to build a continuous improvement culture by improving employee engagement. By doing so, Boston Scientific Coyol's results became sustainable, improvement became part of the operator’s job and overall satisfaction increased. This resulted in 14K ideas proposed by operators over 3 years, 50% improvement in employee retention and absenteeism, 80% reduction in safety recordable incidents and 40% reduction in quality incidents for the last 18 months. Mr. Perera will discuss how this continuous improvement culture help Boston Scientific, Costa Rica become a 2015 Shingo Bronze Medallion recipient.</p>

                                <h5 class="quattrocento">Billy Taylor &amp; Norbert Majerus</h5>
                                <br>
                                <p>Lean has revolutionized manufacturing processes around the world. Unfortunately, that has not been the case for processes dealing with business, administration or R&D. That is very unfortunate because the benefits of applying lean to a process like R&D or innovation creation can be even larger than the benefits achieved in manufacturing. The key is to know how to apply lean in an R&D environment. Goodyear applied lean to what R&D can do for the business, not to how lean can save money in R&D. This helped Goodyear create more and better value for the customer and more profit for the company. Other key factors in the transformation were developing and continuously improving a lean process, collaborating across the value chain, managing the cultural change that lean demands, creating the correct organization to leverage lean, and training and correctly managing people. In this presentation, Billy Taylor and Norbert Majerus we will describe the Goodyear journey, the lean principles that were applied, and the achieved results.</p>

                                <p>The Shingo Model™ has been successfully applied in a wide range of enterprises, including manufacturing, health care, financial institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), etc. The model has also been applied in a limited way within universities – mainly in administrative functions such as housing, dining services and maintenance – but, to the knowledge of the presenter, has never been applied to the core function of the university (i.e., the teaching of students). The presenter will 1) demonstrate how the Shingo Model™ can be applied in an academic setting, thereby demonstrating the universal applicability of the model; and 2) show how to revolutionize higher education by helping institutions focus on the right purpose.</p>

                                <p>Former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt led his nation through two of the greatest crises in its history: the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II. From March 1933 to June 1944 President Roosevelt addressed the American people in some 30 speeches broadcast via radio, speaking on a variety of topics from banking to unemployment to fighting fascism in Europe. Millions of people found comfort and renewed confidence in these speeches, which became known as the "fireside chats."</p>
                                <p>Today, we expand on this concept by bringing in best practitioners and leaders who have a wealth of knowledge on the pursuit of enterprise excellence and how to build a culture of continuous improvement. Spend an evening with these leaders as they share their experience with you in an intimate setting and give you valuable time to ask questions and to network with other like-minded people.</p>

                                <p>Rexam became ECA's partner in 2007. One of the company’s major contributions was the lean enterprise culture. Rexam has operated a global system of Lean Enterprise since 2003, structured around building capability in specific tool sets of Culture, VSM, 5S, TPM, SMED and Six Sigma.</p>
                                <p>Rexam’s best plants were invited to participate in a more sophisticated assessment known as “Beyond Gold,” where the implementation of lean systems is appraised. A system of merit is used to recognize achievement starting at Emerald, then Sapphire and finally Diamond. In recognition of ECA's lean efforts, the first Rexam audit was in 2012. The Guatemala plant applied for the "Beyond Gold" assessment and achieved Sapphire level, and subsequently moved to Diamond in 2013.</p>
                                <p>Improvements are identified and delivered using a matrix organization structure with functional floor leadership called “The Grill” (initiated in 2007). Between 2012 and 2014, 96 Kaizen events took place with 100 percent participation from the people of the plant.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Gaysinsky will speak to this journey while specifically focusing on “Ensuring Quality at the Source" and "Creating Value for the Customer."</p>

                                <h5 class="quattrocento">Manuel Valdes</h5>
                                <br>
                                <p>Sisamex began its journey toward excellence in 1992, always striving to build a solid foundation for sustainable growth. After several years of extensive use of world-class manufacturing tools and concepts, a stop was made in 2011 to ask the questions: “What is the culture of Sisamex that has brought us here? And what should be the culture that takes us far beyond?” These questions were not easy to ask, and there were no direct answers. Sisamex had to find a business model that integrated everything they knew to do and did well, and put systems and tools to work in order to solidify a culture that guaranteed continued success well into the future. Sisamex’s strategy lacked a clearly defined "culture," until they found the Shingo Model™ that helped them translate what they were looking for. Since 2011, Sisamex has developed a culture based on measurable behaviors using systems and tools that will perfectly support its business strategy in the short, medium and long term. In this presentation, Mr. Valdes will share many of Sisamex’s experiences over the years, the good and the not so good, as well as the challenges they still face as they look forward to becoming an "ambidextrous" organization.</p>

                                <h5 class="quattrocento">Richard Schonberger</h5>
                                <br>
                                <p>Most factories have many active products or orders seeking capacity on few producing units. If they are involved with lean, the results may be impressive WITHIN the factory. But, contrary to the Shingo Guiding Principle of Creating Value for the Customer, that narrow focus is often accompanied by extended customer lead times, backorders and inventories—with long operating hours and speed-up efforts to cope. Correctively, and in keeping with the Shingo Guiding Principle of Enterprise Alignment, concurrent production employs multiple work cells/production lines affordably equipped with simpler, lower-cost equipment. Along with customer-focused metrics, this combination allows production of multiple products/orders simultaneously, in close synch with real customer demand/usage.</p>

                                <br>
                                <p>PyMPSA, with more than 25 years of experience manufacturing medical devices, is the largest medical device manufacturing company in México and one of many companies that belong to PiSA Group, the biggest Mexican pharmaceutical company.</p>
                                <p>Over the years PyMPSA has created a lot of different processes in order to satisfy its customer´s needs and comply with the applicable regulations. Somehow some of its systems became complicated to operate, so when PyMPSA started to apply the <em>Shingo Model</em>, one of its goals was to improve the operation but at the same time make it simple.</p>
                                <p>In the beginning, PyMPSA started the reengineering of its processes with the typical top-bottom approach – management design, operators execute. There were some modest results until an apparent “small” and “simple” idea from a group of operators transformed the “daily management system” into the cornerstone of PyMPSA’s operation. Without any hesitation, this was a lesson of humility and is a true example of application of the <em>Shingo Guiding Principles.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Norbert Majerus</strong>, beginning in 2005, has implemented a principles-based lean product development process at the three global innovation centers of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, first in Akron, OH, and then in Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg, and Hanau, Germany. For nearly a decade he has been Goodyear’s lean champion in research and development.</p>
                <p>Mr. Majerus, born and raised in Luxembourg, began his career there at Goodyear in 1979 with responsibility for materials development, aircraft tires, and competitor benchmarking. In 1983 he moved to Akron to start a “short assignment” in innovative products, which continues to this day. During that time he was a recipient of discretionary funding for a revolutionary new product and manufacturing process, and he earned more than 60 patents and trade secrets (patentable idea that the company chose not to patent).</p>
                <p>Further assignments in Akron have included innovative processes; new tire development and project manager for North American, Asian and European OEM customers; corporate benchmarking; design and test standards; activity-based R&D accounting; ISO/QS certification; and more. Mr. Majerus acquired a six sigma master black belt in 2003 and a lean master black belt in 2005. He holds a master’s degree in chemistry from the Universitaet des Saarlandes, Saarbruecken, Germany.</p>
                <p>Mr. Majerus lives in Akron with his wife Isabelle; they have two adult sons, Steve and Laurent, both pursuing engineering careers. His hobbies are mostly sports- and outdoor-related activities — biking, skiing and running — that were idled by a severe skiing accident in 2014.</p>
                <p>Mr. Majerus would appreciate comments and feedback. He can be found on LinkedIn or reached at norbert.majerus@gmail.com or norbert.majerus@goodyear.com.</p>

                <p><strong>Ken</strong> developed an interest in Japanese business practices while living in Japan during the time he was a student. His interest led him to major in Japanese history and then to pursue an MBA for the purpose of working with a Japanese business expanding to the United States. Inspired by the work of Professors Mike Yoshino and William Ouchi, Ken wrote his master’s thesis on “Applying Japanese Business Practices in American Companies.”</p>
                <p>Immediately after graduation, Snyder joined a Japanese electronics manufacturing company and helped lead the establishment of its U.S. affiliate company. As plant manager, and later president of the Japanese affiliate company, Ken led the company through the implementation of TQC, QC Circles, JIT and kanban initiatives. After over ten years with the Japanese affiliate company, Ken led the startup of Progressive Impressions International (PII) in Bloomington, Illinois. In addition to implementing initiatives similar to what was implemented in the Japanese affiliate company, Ken also created a “lean accounting” system even before that term existed. Snyder led the growth of PII from pre-revenue to over $25 million in annual revenues. Before joining the Huntsman School, Snyder was president of Marketing Communication Inc., an operating division of Taylor Corporation, where he directed a group of six companies while growing revenues of the group from $25 million to over $80 million. He joined the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business in 2008.</p>

He was named chairman of the Shingo Executive Advisory Board and executive director of the Shingo Institute in 2015.</p>
                <p>Ken earned an MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business in 1980 with an emphasis in international business. Prior to that he earned a BA in Japanese history from University of Utah in 1978.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Why should I attend the International Shingo Conference?</dt>
            <dd>The #1 reason our participants attend the conference is to learn from insightful speakers and presenters. We work hard to feature people that will inspire, encourage and instruct. Attending the Shingo Conference will give you a fresh perspective and keep you from getting stuck in your own transformation efforts.<br>
            <br>
            Our participants come from various backgrounds and industries and are extremely intelligent and experienced. At the International Shingo Conference, you’ll also have an unparalleled opportunity to meet others like you who are passionate about creating excellence in their work. You’re sure to learn from their experiences as you share your own.</dd>
            <dt>Who attends the conference?</dt>
            <dd>Our diverse mix of attendees come from many fields including manufacturing, healthcare, finance and government. We also have delegates from companies large and small from all over the world. At last year’s conference, we had representation from 22 different countries. Professionals are mostly mid- to senior-level executives with many years of experience in continuous improvement, lean and/or enterprise-wide cultural transformation.</dd>
            <dt>What topics will be discussed throughout the conference?</dt>
            <dd>Our keynote speakers generally share experiences and results of effecting a cultural transformation within their organizations. They talk about the challenges and struggles they faced and continue to face and what they do to succeed in moving forward. Our breakout sessions will be divided into four tracks: manufacturing, healthcare, special topics and Shingo 101. While the focus of each breakout may be around a particular industry, each session will also focus on the Shingo Guiding Principles. As the principles are universal, they apply to every industry in every part of the world.</dd>
            <dt>Hasn’t the Awards Gala been separate from the Main Conference in the past?</dt>
            <dd>In the past, we’ve held an opening social to kick off the Main Conference. We then ended the week with the Awards Gala where we celebrate and honor the recipients of the Shingo Prize, Silver/Bronze Medallions and Research and Professional Publication Award. As the Awards Gala has been such an enriching experience for attendees in the past, we are combining the Opening Social with the Awards Gala so all conference participants can have the opportunity to join us. With a delicious dinner and excellent entertainment, you won’t want to miss it!</dd>
            <dt>What is included in the cost of the Main Conference?</dt>
            <dd>The Main Conference registration includes access to the Awards Gala on the evening of Tuesday, May 5, keynote speaker presentations, breakout sessions and breakfast and lunch on Wednesday and Thursday and the closing social. You can add pre-conference workshops, the Fireside Chat and Site Tours to your registration separately.</dd>
            <dt>Where can I stay?</dt>
            <dd>We have available room blocks at the Marriott Hotel across the street from the Conference Center. See <a href="http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=27th%20International%20Shingo%20Conference%5Eslcvo%60iscisca%7Cisciscc%60124.00%60USD%60false%605/3/15%605/8/15%604/12/15&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes" target="_blank">here</a> for information on obtaining a room.</dd>
