								<h4>The Power of an Engaged Workforce</h4>
								<h5 class="quattrocento">Eilish Henry</h5>
								<br>
								<p>For almost 30 years the Shingo Model™ has helped leaders of organizations across the world to see the reality of their own organizational culture. The foundation of the Model is cultural enablers – people! As a long-standing affiliate of the Shingo Institute, SISU Consulting Group has worked with clients from many different sectors and countries to help them bring the Shingo Model to life and to build a culture of real people engagement. Over the past 15 years, SISU has had the privilege to work with 27 companies who have achieved levels of Shingo recognition, including three out of the five most recent Shingo Prize recipients. In this session, Eilish Henry will share some of SISU’s learnings and discuss how they have supported their clients in building truly empowered workforces through the process of co-creation.</p>

								<h4>Continuously Improving Your Continuous Improvement Program</h4>
								<h5 class="quattrocento">Andrew Lahy</h5>
								<br>
								<p>Three years ago, Panalpina – a global logistics organization with over 16,000 employees located in more than 80 different countries – started a global continuous improvement program. Andrew Lahy will explain how the company placed continuous improvement at the heart of its global strategy, whilst at the same time making a conscious decision not to do a typical top-down approach. The approach gave their teams the flexibility to adapt and develop their own methods of continuous improvement around the world. As a result, Panalpina’s continuous improvement approach (LogEx) has spread quickly across the globe and has been adapted and improved by different local management teams. Now, thanks to the creativity and efforts of the teams around the world, LogEx has completely transformed from its original beginnings, and today is increasingly used as a spring board for innovation and creative thinking in the organization.</p>

								<h5 class="quattrocento">Karlijn van den Berg</h5>

								<p>Worldwide operating bank ABN AMRO, with its home base in the Netherlands, started a customer excellence program in 2010 based on lean. Since then the program has touched over 85% of the employees, embedding many valuable lean practices. The focus is now to bring customer excellence to the "Next Level" in which benefit tracking is one of the challenges. How can we ensure that customer excellence is more than a useful toolbox? Karlijn van den Berg will discuss how ABN AMRO ensures its strategic impact is made and also captured.</p>

								<h4>“What Goes Around Comes Around” or “Do Unto Others?” – Strong Reciprocity as Quintessential Shingo</h4>
								<h5 class="quattrocento">Rick Edgeman, Ph.D.</h5>
								<br>
								<p>The Shingo Model™ is derived from 10 foundational principles or maxims that give rise to three insights of enterprise excellence. A principle is a foundational rule that is universal and timeless, self-evident and antecedent to specific and nearly inevitable consequences. Principles often birth familiar adages that are widely accepted as capturing an embedded truth; e.g., “actions speak louder than words” or its near twin “the proof is in the pudding” speak to the principle that tangibles provide more solid evidence of reality than do intangibles. Herein provided is an argument for an overarching maxim as the “Quintessential Shingo Principle:” reciprocity, familiar adages for which include “what goes around, comes around” and “do unto others as you would have others do unto you,” with one of these stated in the negative and the other in the affirmative.</p>
								<p>Dr. Edgeman will discuss systems and tools that support organizational reciprocity and advance enterprise excellence. Among these are the conjunctive ones of benchmarking and co-creative innovation processes. Crowdsourcing and citizen sourcing provide special cases of co-creative innovation processes that contribute to the evolution of enterprises operating in relative isolation toward coalitions or networks forming more pervasive enterprise ecosystems. Dr. Edgeman will present the view that proliferation of reciprocity serves as a key enabler of a virtuous cycle leading to sustainable enterprise abundance wherein an enterprise and its people routinely prosper, relative to environmental conditions.</p>

								<h4>Principles, Behaviors and Systems: From Theory to Reality</h4>
								<h5 class="quattrocento">Peter Hines</h5>
								<br>
								<p>Many successful companies have attempted lean or continuous improvement programs for years, but often their progress has slowed or plateaued. This is very common and associated with a whole range of factors, such as changes in senior leadership, a lack of buy-in from some senior or middle managers, no ownership from front-line staff, and/or an often consultant-inspired focus on tools and kaizen events.</p>
								<p>In his research while leading the Lean Enterprise Research Centre at Cardiff University, Professor Hines identified some key learnings in his first Shingo Research Award-winning book Staying Lean. He found the underlying cause of these issues in nearly all cases was that organizations had focused primarily on the ‘above the waterline’ areas of technology, tools and techniques – such as 5S, kanban and standard work – as well as business processes by employing tools like value stream mapping. What was missing in most cases was a focus on the ‘underwater’ areas of strategy and alignment, leadership, and behavior and engagement.</p>
								<p>Similarly, the Shingo Institute at Utah State University found the same pattern in many U.S. companies. As a result they developed a behavioral-based approach to improvement termed operational excellence, and then widened the scope of their work to the whole organization, designating it as enterprise excellence. In this session, Prof. Hines will discuss enterprise excellence and explore how principles, behaviors and systems can be made to work in a European context in a practical way.</p>

AV’s challenge is to replicate success within its other facilities. After collective reflection by the AV leadership team on what has been the secret to Clonmel’s success, they developed an approach to spread the best practices and culture to other facilities.

								<p><strong>“We’re not Japanese and we don’t make cars:” Can Quality Improvement save Healthcare?</strong></p>
								<p>After a decade with all manufacturing processes connected to a mini-factory, O.C. Tanner finally took apart each support department (tooling, stores, systems, process owners, warehousing, engineering, purchasing and production control) and put together entire value streams from supplier to customer. The production worker’s jobs had already changed, but now everyone else’s job has changed as well, including each of the three vice presidents who became value stream VPs instead of VPs of manufacturing, supply chain and Tanner Improvement System. In this presentation, Gary Peterson will describe the change, what went well, what went badly, and the results O.C. Tanner is achieving.</p>

								<h4>Enterprise Excellence in Healthcare</h4>
								<h5 class="quattrocento">David Fillingham</h5>
								<br>
								<p><strong>“We’re not Japanese and we don’t make cars:” Can Quality Improvement save Healthcare?</strong></p>
								<p>It’s true that hospitals aren’t factories and patients are neither products nor raw materials.  But that doesn’t mean that healthcare can’t learn lessons from quality improvement approaches that have been highly successful in manufacturing and other sectors.</p>
								<p>In this session, David Fillingham will describe the joys and the frustrations of leading transformation in a healthcare setting.  In particular he will: -</p>
								<ul class="indent" style="list-style:circle">
									<li>Examine the evidence base on what the highest quality healthcare organizations do;</li>
									<li>Describe successful improvement programmes which have enhanced the safety and reliability of care for patients</li>
									<li>Consider the learning from case – examples where Toyota Production  approaches have been applied to hospitals</li>
									<li>Discuss the crucial role of leadership and culture in sustaining and spreading improvements</li>
									<li>Suggest valuable lessons which other sectors might take from healthcare’s experience</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Across the world healthcare systems are being squeezed between increased demand from ageing populations and tighter finances in a post austerity era.  David will argue that the systematic application of quality improvement at pace and scale would deliver enormous benefits for individual patients and for society as a whole.</p>
