                  <p>Worldwide operating bank ABN AMRO, with its home base in the Netherlands, started a customer excellence program in 2010 based on lean. Since then the program has touched over 85% of the employees, embedding many valuable lean practices. The focus is now to bring customer excellence to the "Next Level" in which benefit tracking is one of the challenges. How can we ensure that customer excellence is more than a useful toolbox? Karlijn van den Berg will discuss how ABN AMRO ensures its strategic impact is made and also captured.</p>

                  <h4>“What Goes Around Comes Around” or “Do Unto Others?” – Strong Reciprocity as Quintessential Shingo</h4>
                  <h5 class="quattrocento">Rick Edgeman, Ph.D.</h5>
                  <br>
                  <p>The Shingo Model™ is derived from 10 foundational principles or maxims that give rise to three insights of enterprise excellence. A principle is a foundational rule that is universal and timeless, self-evident and antecedent to specific and nearly inevitable consequences. Principles often birth familiar adages that are widely accepted as capturing an embedded truth; e.g., “actions speak louder than words” or its near twin “the proof is in the pudding” speak to the principle that tangibles provide more solid evidence of reality than do intangibles. Herein provided is an argument for an overarching maxim as the “Quintessential Shingo Principle:” reciprocity, familiar adages for which include “what goes around, comes around” and “do unto others as you would have others do unto you,” with one of these stated in the negative and the other in the affirmative.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Edgeman will discuss systems and tools that support organizational reciprocity and advance enterprise excellence. Among these are the conjunctive ones of benchmarking and co-creative innovation processes. Crowdsourcing and citizen sourcing provide special cases of co-creative innovation processes that contribute to the evolution of enterprises operating in relative isolation toward coalitions or networks forming more pervasive enterprise ecosystems. Dr. Edgeman will present the view that proliferation of reciprocity serves as a key enabler of a virtuous cycle leading to sustainable enterprise abundance wherein an enterprise and its people routinely prosper, relative to environmental conditions.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Jon Alder will explore the journey taken by Rexam to attain operational excellence. Lessons learned and the mistakes made will be candidly reflected upon as the story is told of how a global manufacturing business navigated its way along an evolving path of continuous improvement to become a leading exponent of the Shingo Prize challenge. The thinking behind Rexam's actions, the systems operated and the tools used will all be discussed, as will the reality of how much there is still left to do.</p>

                  <h4>Principles, Behaviors and Systems: From Theory to Reality</h4>
                  <h5 class="quattrocento">Peter Hines</h5>
                  <br>
                  <p>Many successful companies have attempted lean or continuous improvement programs for years, but often their progress has slowed or plateaued. This is very common and associated with a whole range of factors, such as changes in senior leadership, a lack of buy-in from some senior or middle managers, no ownership from front-line staff, and/or an often consultant-inspired focus on tools and kaizen events.</p>
                  <p>In his research while leading the Lean Enterprise Research Centre at Cardiff University, Professor Hines identified some key learnings in his first Shingo Research Award-winning book Staying Lean. He found the underlying cause of these issues in nearly all cases was that organizations had focused primarily on the ‘above the waterline’ areas of technology, tools and techniques – such as 5S, kanban and standard work – as well as business processes by employing tools like value stream mapping. What was missing in most cases was a focus on the ‘underwater’ areas of strategy and alignment, leadership, and behavior and engagement.</p>
                  <p>Similarly, the Shingo Institute at Utah State University found the same pattern in many U.S. companies. As a result they developed a behavioral-based approach to improvement termed operational excellence, and then widened the scope of their work to the whole organization, designating it as enterprise excellence. In this session, Prof. Hines will discuss enterprise excellence and explore how principles, behaviors and systems can be made to work in a European context in a practical way.</p>

                    <p>Former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt led his nation through two of the greatest crises in its history: the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II. From March 1933 to June 1944 President Roosevelt addressed the American people in some 30 speeches broadcast via radio, speaking on a variety of topics from banking to unemployment to fighting fascism in Europe. Millions of people found comfort and renewed confidence in these speeches, which became known as the "fireside chats."</p>
                    <p>Today, we expand on this concept by bringing in best practitioners and leaders who have a wealth of knowledge on the pursuit of enterprise excellence and how to build a culture of continuous improvement. Spend an evening with these leaders as they share their experience with you in an intimate setting and give you valuable time to ask questions and to network with other like-minded people.</p>

He has learned that the best companies in the world are led by people who are open to constructive challenge and willing to commit themselves to optimizing their leadership performance. They are visible role models and coaches; they create a culture of listening, looking, seeing, planning, acting, supporting and sustaining. They create alignment and energy for the pursuit of optimized business results and optimized people engagement.</p>

AV’s challenge is to replicate success within its other facilities. After collective reflection by the AV leadership team on what has been the secret to Clonmel’s success, they developed an approach to spread the best practices and culture to other facilities. Michael Crowe will discuss this approach, which is applicable to any organization on their journey to manufacturing excellence.</p>

                    <p>Is the Shingo Model™ really an effective business transformational model for integrating behavioral principles with lean manufacturing principles to help aid or sustain the lean transformation? George Donaldson, who recently completed his master’s degree in lean enterprise at Buckingham University, will draw on his practical experience of winning the Shingo Prize at Newsprinters, and his ever-increasing knowledge of the theory, to answer the questions: What is the value of aligning the Shingo Guiding Principles with lean manufacturing tools and systems? How do you do it? And how does it provide sustainable benefits?</p>

                    <p>After a decade with all manufacturing processes connected to a mini-factory, O.C. Tanner finally took apart each support department (tooling, stores, systems, process owners, warehousing, engineering, purchasing and production control) and put together entire value streams from supplier to customer. The production worker’s jobs had already changed, but now everyone else’s job has changed as well, including each of the three vice presidents who became value stream VPs instead of VPs of manufacturing, supply chain and Tanner Improvement System. In this presentation, Gary Peterson will describe the change, what went well, what went badly, and the results O.C. Tanner is achieving.</p>

                    <ul class="indent" style="list-style:circle">
                      <li>Examine the evidence base on what the highest quality healthcare organizations do;</li>
                      <li>Describe successful improvement programmes which have enhanced the safety and reliability of care for patients</li>
                      <li>Consider the learning from case – examples where Toyota Production  approaches have been applied to hospitals</li>
                      <li>Discuss the crucial role of leadership and culture in sustaining and spreading improvements</li>

                    <p>Across the world healthcare systems are being squeezed between increased demand from ageing populations and tighter finances in a post austerity era.

            <p><strong>Ken</strong> developed an interest in Japanese business practices while living in Japan during the time he was a student. His interest led him to major in Japanese history and then to pursue an MBA for the purpose of working with a Japanese business expanding to the United States. Inspired by the work of Professors Mike Yoshino and William Ouchi, Ken wrote his master’s thesis on “Applying Japanese Business Practices in American Companies.”</p>
            <p>Immediately after graduation, Snyder joined a Japanese electronics manufacturing company and helped lead the establishment of its U.S. affiliate company. As plant manager, and later president of the Japanese affiliate company, Ken led the company through the implementation of TQC, QC Circles, JIT and kanban initiatives. After over ten years with the Japanese affiliate company, Ken led the startup of Progressive Impressions International (PII) in Bloomington, Illinois. In addition to implementing initiatives similar to what was implemented in the Japanese affiliate company, Ken also created a “lean accounting” system even before that term existed. Snyder led the growth of PII from pre-revenue to over $25 million in annual revenues. Before joining the Huntsman School, Snyder was president of Marketing Communication Inc., an operating division of Taylor Corporation, where he directed a group of six companies while growing revenues of the group from $25 million to over $80 million. He joined the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business in 2008.</p>
            <p>Ken has served on numerous boards, including as a member of the Shingo Institute Executive Advisory Board since 2009. Ken has also been a Shingo examiner since 2010. He was named chairman of the Shingo Executive Advisory Board and executive director of the Shingo Institute in 2015.</p>
            <p>Ken earned an MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business in 1980 with an emphasis in international business. Prior to that he earned a BA in Japanese history from University of Utah in 1978.</p>

His career began in operational management for the Siebe organization (to become Invensys Plc), a provider of world-class power supply solutions for blue chip companies such as BT, Siemens, Philips and Raytheon.</p>
            <p>At Siebe in 1997, Mr. Alder embarked on a journey of implementing six sigma and lean enterprise, with responsibility to lead its lean and six sigma initiatives across the Power Systems division in regions as diverse as Mexico, Malaysia and China, the US and Europe.</p>
            <p>Mr. Alder then moved to global consumer packaging company Rexam, to lead the deployment of lean enterprise and six sigma across more than 100 plants worldwide. In 2011, he started a program to move Rexam forward towards the Shingo Prize, where Rexam now has accreditation for 11 plants including two Shingo Prizes. Rexam’s global lean program has delivered more than £300 million in efficiency savings since 2004 and continues to push forward with an intense philosophy of “Zero Loss.”</p>
            <p>In the last 8 years, Mr. Alder’s work has included the creation and deployment of an innovation system for Rexam and a continuous improvement focus to advance its global health and safety program. More recently he led the development and adoption of a sustainability strategy across the Rexam business before returning to refocus the organization on its continuous improvement and lean enterprise aims.</p>

            <p><strong>Nicola Murphy</strong> joined Lake Region Medical’s New Ross facility in 1999 as a production associate. Since then Ms. Murphy has advanced through several positions within the company as trainer, team leader and supervisor. Her introduction to lean manufacturing was in 2003 when, in the role of supervisor, she was involved in Lake Region Medical’s first kaizen event.

In June 2013, Nicola moved to the position of Shingo Prize champion to support Lake Region Medical’s 2015 Shingo Prize challenge.</p>
