							<p><strong>Jon Alder</strong> has spent over 25 years in manufacturing and operational excellence working for global FTSE 100 companies. His career began in operational management for the Siebe organization (to become Invensys Plc), a provider of world-class power supply solutions for blue chip companies such as BT, Siemens, Philips and Raytheon.</p>
							<p>At Siebe in 1997, Mr. Alder embarked on a journey of implementing six sigma and lean enterprise, with responsibility to lead its lean and six sigma initiatives across the Power Systems division in regions as diverse as Mexico, Malaysia and China, the US and Europe.</p>
							<p>Mr. Alder then moved to global consumer packaging company Rexam, to lead the deployment of lean enterprise and six sigma across more than 100 plants worldwide. In 2011, he started a program to move Rexam forward towards the Shingo Prize, where Rexam now has accreditation for 11 plants including two Shingo Prizes. Rexam’s global lean program has delivered more than £300 million in efficiency savings since 2004 and continues to push forward with an intense philosophy of “Zero Loss.”</p>
							<p>In the last 8 years, Mr. Alder’s work has included the creation and deployment of an innovation system for Rexam and a continuous improvement focus to advance its global health and safety program. More recently he led the development and adoption of a sustainability strategy across the Rexam business before returning to refocus the organization on its continuous improvement and lean enterprise aims.</p>
							<p>Mr. Alder is a six sigma master black belt covering both operational black belt and design for six sigma.</p>
