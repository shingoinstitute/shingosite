                            <h4>Connecting the Lean Dots for the Organization: Align Your Lean Initiative to Maximize Your Full Business Potential</h4>
                            <p><strong>Bill Baker &amp; Ken Rolfes</strong></p>
                            <p>Lean typically originates within the operations functions of a business. After initial successes with foundational lean tools, such as 5S, standardized work and the visual workplace, attention turns to accelerating the flow of materials and information. Many organizations plateau and become disillusioned when they don't see the bottom-line results originally anticipated. When this occurs, lean efforts are often abandoned while the organization comforts itself with the notion lean was not applicable to its business, or “We’ve done lean, now what’s next?” Why does this occur and how can it be avoided?</p>
                            <p>The answer can be traced to the original impetus for the lean initiative and its advertised benefits. There are two kinds of lean efforts. The most common is the tools approach centered on eliminating wastes with pull systems, kaizen events, quick changeovers, etc. Most can recite the eight different wastes. Many recognize that any organization will never completely eliminate all wastes, and assume that an organization tenaciously pursuing waste elimination with a continuous improvement mindset will by default achieve operational improvements. As a result, only a few functional departments in the company adopt lean.</p>
                            <p>The other approach is strategic lean where leading-edge companies recognize and adopt lean as a management system to build leadership, productivity and growth. Leading companies from the outset articulate expectations for the organization to be able to measure success. Lean-focused organizations identify the customer value derived from the products and services they offer and continually work to improve the value delivered and the processes employed to deliver that value. In summary, strategic lean is a customer-centric business model and a lean management system to support the model.</p>
                            <p>In this workshop attendees will learn how to move beyond the tools approach and begin to connect the dots with their company’s business model and translate the benefits of a lean initiative into financial metrics. Specifically, to see lean as an organizational strategy for driving growth, profitability and capability to continually transform the business to benefit from the continually changing market place.</p>

                            <p>American healthcare faces serious problems with quality, cost, access and employee engagement. Lean offers a powerful approach to deep and meaningful improvement. This workshop will delineate lean’s central philosophy, principles and tools and illustrate via numerous examples how they can be effectively applied across the healthcare landscape. Dr. Gabow and Mr. Goodman will lay out an effective, cost-efficient plan and will discuss the role of leadership in any transformational implementation. The critical role of identification and management of metrics will be underscored. The presenters will also share examples of quality, financial and employee metrics, and highlight the impressive results achieved within one integrated healthcare system. The workshop will conclude with lessons learned that can be applicable to achieving operational excellence in healthcare as well as other industries.</p>

                            <p><strong>John Lee</strong></p>
                            <p>One of the reasons companies have such short life spans is because they do not understand how to effectively transform themselves. John Lee, author of <em>Rising Above It All</em> and president of Alpha Quality Consulting, defines organizational transformation as evolving to higher levels of sustained performance. He has found that most companies are capable of evolving to a given level of performance – the 95% level. One of the problems in transformation is that the skill set needed to reach the 95% performance level is not the same skill set needed to rise above the 95% level of performance. Most organizations do not understand this phenomenon; and as a result, companies will eventually go extinct as customer expectations rise.</p>
                            <p>In this interactive workshop, participants will learn how to implement the three elements of transformation – personal transformation, cultural transformation and tools transformation. Most companies skip the personal and cultural transformation and jump right into the tools transformation, which is the reason companies die at such a young age. Organizations need a culture that supports modern-day analytical tools, including tools used in the planning process, or the tools will not effectively work within the borders of the organization. Participants will learn how to incorporate all three elements of a transformation by creating a supply chain built from catapults and other raw materials. This team-based activity is applicable to real-life and will help you gain inspiration to the wonders of lifting your organization “above it all.”</p>

                            <p>Organizations are enveloped in constantly changing and increasingly challenging competitive landscapes. As means of enhancing their competitive positioning, performance, resilience, and robustness – not to mention their survivability – organizations are more and more commonly pursuing excellence. Excellence is a moving target that goes by many names: operational excellence, business excellence, performance excellence or enterprise excellence. This panel addresses the pursuit of excellence as seen from the perspective of globally acknowledged authorities representing the Juran Institute, Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Program and the Shingo Institute.</p>

                              <p>Former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt led his nation through two of the greatest crises in its history: the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II. From March 1933 to June 1944 President Roosevelt addressed the American people in some 30 speeches broadcast via radio, speaking on a variety of topics from banking to unemployment to fighting fascism in Europe. Millions of people found comfort and renewed confidence in these speeches, which became known as the "fireside chats."</p>
                              <p>Today, we expand on this concept by bringing in best practitioners and leaders who have a wealth of knowledge on the pursuit of enterprise excellence and how to build a culture of continuous improvement. Spend an evening with these leaders as they share their experience with you in an intimate setting and give you valuable time to ask questions and to network with other like-minded people.</p>

                <p><strong>Ken</strong> developed an interest in Japanese business practices while living in Japan during the time he was a student. His interest led him to major in Japanese history and then to pursue an MBA for the purpose of working with a Japanese business expanding to the United States. Inspired by the work of Professors Mike Yoshino and William Ouchi, Ken wrote his master’s thesis on “Applying Japanese Business Practices in American Companies.”</p>
                <p>Immediately after graduation, Snyder joined a Japanese electronics manufacturing company and helped lead the establishment of its U.S. affiliate company. As plant manager, and later president of the Japanese affiliate company, Ken led the company through the implementation of TQC, QC Circles, JIT and kanban initiatives. After over ten years with the Japanese affiliate company, Ken led the startup of Progressive Impressions International (PII) in Bloomington, Illinois. In addition to implementing initiatives similar to what was implemented in the Japanese affiliate company, Ken also created a “lean accounting” system even before that term existed. Snyder led the growth of PII from pre-revenue to over $25 million in annual revenues. Before joining the Huntsman School, Snyder was president of Marketing Communication Inc., an operating division of Taylor Corporation, where he directed a group of six companies while growing revenues of the group from $25 million to over $80 million. He joined the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business in 2008.</p>
                <p>Ken has served on numerous boards, including as a member of the Shingo Institute Executive Advisory Board since 2009. Ken has also been a Shingo examiner since 2010. He was named chairman of the Shingo Executive Advisory Board and executive director of the Shingo Institute in 2015.</p>
                <p>Ken earned an MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business in 1980 with an emphasis in international business. Prior to that he earned a BA in Japanese history from University of Utah in 1978.</p>
