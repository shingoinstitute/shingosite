                            <p><strong>Bill Baker &amp; Ken Rolfes</strong></p>
                            <p>Lean typically originates within the operations functions of a business. After initial successes with foundational lean tools, such as 5S, standardized work and the visual workplace, attention turns to accelerating the flow of materials and information. Many organizations plateau and become disillusioned when they don't see the bottom-line results originally anticipated. When this occurs, lean efforts are often abandoned while the organization comforts itself with the notion lean was not applicable to its business, or “We’ve done lean, now what’s next?” Why does this occur and how can it be avoided?</p>
                            <p>The answer can be traced to the original impetus for the lean initiative and its advertised benefits. There are two kinds of lean efforts. The most common is the tools approach centered on eliminating wastes with pull systems, kaizen events, quick changeovers, etc. Most can recite the eight different wastes. Many recognize that any organization will never completely eliminate all wastes, and assume that an organization tenaciously pursuing waste elimination with a continuous improvement mindset will by default achieve operational improvements. As a result, only a few functional departments in the company adopt lean.</p>
                            <p>The other approach is strategic lean where leading-edge companies recognize and adopt lean as a management system to build leadership, productivity and growth. Leading companies from the outset articulate expectations for the organization to be able to measure success. Lean-focused organizations identify the customer value derived from the products and services they offer and continually work to improve the value delivered and the processes employed to deliver that value. In summary, strategic lean is a customer-centric business model and a lean management system to support the model.</p>
                            <p>In this workshop attendees will learn how to move beyond the tools approach and begin to connect the dots with their company’s business model and translate the benefits of a lean initiative into financial metrics. Specifically, to see lean as an organizational strategy for driving growth, profitability and capability to continually transform the business to benefit from the continually changing market place.</p>

                            <p>American healthcare faces serious problems with quality, cost, access and employee engagement. Lean offers a powerful approach to deep and meaningful improvement. This workshop will delineate lean’s central philosophy, principles and tools and illustrate via numerous examples how they can be effectively applied across the healthcare landscape. Dr. Gabow and Mr. Goodman will lay out an effective, cost-efficient plan and will discuss the role of leadership in any transformational implementation. The critical role of identification and management of metrics will be underscored. The presenters will also share examples of quality, financial and employee metrics, and highlight the impressive results achieved within one integrated healthcare system. The workshop will conclude with lessons learned that can be applicable to achieving operational excellence in healthcare as well as other industries.</p>

                            <p><strong>George Trachilis</strong></p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>You can learn everything you want about the Toyota Way. You can implement the tools they have created, but if you do not have the behaviors established within your culture, it will not be successful for long-term sustainment of operational excellence. Leadership must walk the talk of true north in every aspect of the Lean Leadership Development Model (LLDM) as conveyed in detail by Dr. Jeffrey Liker and Gary Convis.</p>
                            <p>The LLDM is the centerpiece of this entire workshop. George Trachilis, a professional engineer and master lean coach, presents this workshop based on Dr. Liker’s 2016 Shingo Research Award-winning book, <em>Developing Lean Leaders at All Levels: A Practical Guide</em>. As an award recipient for his contribution to the book, Mr. Trachilis will expand significantly on the elements of lean, structuring them in a specific way that can be operationalized by leadership in any industry.</p>
                            <p>The workshop structure will take the form of the LLDM and include discussion on the true north values of the Toyota Way, Toyota business practices, and the Toyota kata methodology. The four steps of the LLDM are 1) Commit to Self-Development, 2) Coach and Develop Others, 3) Support Daily Kaizen, and 4) Hoshin Kanri. The workshop answers the questions:</p>
                              <ul class="square">
                                <li>What critical tools are needed to turn the theory to practice?</li>
                                <li>How can I apply this in my organization?</li>
                                <li>What concrete actions can I take to begin the journey of becoming a lean leader?</li>
                                <li>How can I spread this learning to all parts of the organization?</li>
                              </ul>
                            <p>Mr. Trachilis will share examples from Dr. Liker’s more than 20 years of experience (via video format) in working with companies outside of Toyota, as well as his own perspective as a 20+-year lean practitioner who has been implementing aspects of the Toyota Way in companies around the world. Mr. Trachilis will also share some of the tips and tricks he uses to engage long-distance learning students. All participants of this workshop will receive lifetime access at no cost to the online course that Dr. Liker presents.</p>

                            <p>One of the reasons companies have such short life spans is because they do not understand how to effectively transform themselves. John Lee, author of <em>Rising Above It All</em> and president of Alpha Quality Consulting, defines organizational transformation as evolving to higher levels of sustained performance. He has found that most companies are capable of evolving to a given level of performance – the 95% level. One of the problems in transformation is that the skill set needed to reach the 95% performance level is not the same skill set needed to rise above the 95% level of performance. Most organizations do not understand this phenomenon; and as a result, companies will eventually go extinct as customer expectations rise.</p>
                            <p>In this interactive workshop, participants will learn how to implement the three elements of transformation – personal transformation, cultural transformation and tools transformation. Most companies skip the personal and cultural transformation and jump right into the tools transformation, which is the reason companies die at such a young age. Organizations need a culture that supports modern-day analytical tools, including tools used in the planning process, or the tools will not effectively work within the borders of the organization. Participants will learn how to incorporate all three elements of a transformation by creating a supply chain built from catapults and other raw materials. This team-based activity is applicable to real-life and will help you gain inspiration to the wonders of lifting your organization “above it all.”</p>

                            <h4>Building the Fit Organization</h4>
                            <p><strong>Daniel Markovitz</strong></p>
                            <p>The corporate landscape is littered with the carcasses of companies that have failed in their pursuit of the Toyota Way. Their efforts fail precisely because they’re trying to copy Toyota. </p>
                            <p>Trying to be like Toyota is a mistake. What leaders need to do instead is learn from Toyota—learn how to convert their competent organizations into dynamic, constantly improving, profoundly customer-focused entities. A “fit” organization has the ability to continually improve in a manner that delivers superior performance and results over the long haul. </p>
                            <p>This workshop, based on the Shingo Research Award-winning book, <em>Building the Fit Organization</em>, distills the lessons from the Toyota Production System into six core concepts, and couches them in the easily understandable language of physical fitness and athletic excellence—no Japanese, no English jargon, and no off-putting references to Toyota. By the end of the workshop, your team will be ready to make your organization faster, more competitive, and better able to win in your market. </p>
                            <p>This workshop combines lecture with group exercises to help you develop an approach for embedding continuous improvement mindsets and behaviors in the unique environment of your organization. </p>

                            <p><strong>Mike Orzen</strong></p>
                            <p>Building a great organization requires effective leadership. It turns out that leadership skills can be learned and mastered; however, a key element that is often misunderstood is what it means to lead with respect. This workshop explores why leading with respect is essential in a successful transformation, what respect looks like in practice, and how it impacts your people to drive lasting change for the better. </p>
                            <p>Leading with respect involves awareness of our focus and how effectively we are connecting with people to create sustained high levels of performance. This is accomplished through the application of seven core practices: </p>
                            <ul class="square">
                              <li>Go and See for Yourself</li>
                              <li>Creating a Meaningful Challenge</li>
                              <li>Effective Listening</li>
                              <li>Teaching and Coaching</li>
                              <li>Supporting Others</li>
                              <li>Fostering Teamwork</li>
                              <li>Learning as a Leader</li>
                              <li>Results &amp; Relationships</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Organizations are a reflection of their leadership, and if change needs to happen, it often needs to begin at the top. Through practice, we learn and gradually begin to master the seven practices to become more effective leaders and create healthier high-performance organizations. This is a personal journey of growth, sometimes quite challenging, which transforms individuals and companies. It is tough work and not for someone who believes that needed changes do not include themselves. Come and learn what leading with respect is all about, and discover how to drive new behaviors and results in your company. </p>

                            <p>Organizations are enveloped in constantly changing and increasingly challenging competitive landscapes. As means of enhancing their competitive positioning, performance, resilience, and robustness – not to mention their survivability – organizations are more and more commonly pursuing excellence. Excellence is a moving target that goes by many names: operational excellence, business excellence, performance excellence or enterprise excellence. This panel addresses the pursuit of excellence as seen from the perspective of globally acknowledged authorities representing the Juran Institute, Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Program and the Shingo Institute.</p>

                              <br>
                              <p>Improving “leanness” should show up as quicker response, better quality, lower costs—and, prominently, rising inventory turnover. Yet, research involving more than 1,500 global companies shows long-term value-chain inventory turns falling, rising, falling ... in multi-year cycles, with nearly all regions showing worsening inventory turns in the new millennium. Grouped by industry sector, the studies show electrical products with the best multi-year leanness trends, and process-industry companies (e.g., pharmaceuticals, basic metals, and textiles) among the poorest. Other findings point to tendencies for companies to focus inwardly on operations (WIP), as opposed to customer-oriented external flows (finished goods)—contrary to the <em>Shingo Guiding Principle</em> of Creating Value for the Customer. The research suggests, further, that consistently rising inventory turns may serve as a useful indicator of adherence to the <em>Shingo Guiding Principle</em> of Enterprise Alignment, and a catch-all indicator of organizational effectiveness. Dr. Richard Schonberger will discuss the global leanness studies and share how they relate to the <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em>.</p>

The key to O&amp;B’s success is centered on gaining and maintaining the confidence of the Lab’s management and the technical teams (scientists and engineers) supporting nationally relevant research and development. To achieve this, O&amp;B must deliver high quality products and services safely, securely, on time and under budget.</p>
                              <p>In this session, Mark Martinez, O&amp;B’s leader, will discuss how his organization is endeavoring to become a better steward of the Lab’s resources and trust by embracing a common set of principles from the top levels of management and then throughout the organization, thus creating and reinforcing a workplace culture of respect and continuous improvement. Mr. Martinez will describe O&amp;B’s journey in operational excellence—where they’ve been, where they’re going, and how they’re getting there.</p>

From March 1933 to June 1944 President Roosevelt addressed the American people in some 30 speeches broadcast via radio, speaking on a variety of topics from banking to unemployment to fighting fascism in Europe. Millions of people found comfort and renewed confidence in these speeches, which became known as the "fireside chats."</p>
                              <p>Today, we expand on this concept by bringing in best practitioners and leaders who have a wealth of knowledge on the pursuit of enterprise excellence and how to build a culture of continuous improvement. Spend an evening with these leaders as they share their experience with you in an intimate setting and give you valuable time to ask questions and to network with other like-minded people.</p>

                              <p>In 2011, Canada’s Saskatchewan healthcare system suffered from long wait times and an estimated 5,600 adverse events, including 495 patient deaths, annually. In order to address these issues, John Black and Associates was engaged to begin a lean transformation with the province’s 40,000 healthcare providers. After four years of work, their case provides crucial insights into the success factors, pitfalls and impressive results of implementing lean healthcare in a huge health system. The presenters will help attendees explore whether lean is right for their organizations. The perspectives of involved patients, patient advocates, senior leaders and frontline healthcare workers clearly demonstrate both the potential and the challenges of lean implementation; but the results using Shingo’s zero quality control methods were instrumental in dramatically improving patient safety and satisfaction and lowering organizational costs.</p>

                              <p>This session will focus on the “why, how and what” of a lean transformation in an American healthcare system. Dr. Patricia Gabow will establish the why for the transformation and present the how by demonstrating that lean is an ideal approach at the individual health system level. She will highlight this approach by presenting the lean journey at Denver Health, a large urban safety net healthcare system. The what of such a lean journey will include quality, cost, and employee satisfaction outcomes, along with the lessons learned during the lean transformation.</p>

                              <p>“Nationwide is On Your Side” is more than a tagline. It’s a promise made to customers to protect what matters most. A big part of that promise is kept through a lean journey that started seven years ago. With recognition that IT is increasingly a key differentiator, Nationwide embarked on a lean IT transformation in 2009 to build industry-leading software engineering capabilities.  Fast-forward to the present, and the lean transformation has enabled this 9000+ person IT organization to deliver great solutions to customers and partners with industry-leading quality.</p>
                              <p>Tom Paider, associate vice president and build capability leader, will present a lean system that guides all aspects of software engineering, including a lean management system from the frontline to the C-Suite. He will focus on problem solving, transparency and accountability, and he will describe what is possible when technology and lean collide.</p>

                              <h5 class="quattrocento">Matthew Dixon, Ph.D.</h5>
                              <p>Group Leader, Financial Services and Customer Contact Practices CEB</p>
                              <p>The most common approach to customer loyalty today is devoting limitless time, energy and resources trying to dazzle people and inspire customers’ undying loyalty. But the book from CEB, <em>The Effortless Experience</em>, uses over five years of research and tens of thousands of respondents to reveal that the “dazzle factor” is wildly overrated. Consider this: what do customers really want from their cable company – a free month of HBO when it screws up, or a fast, painless restoration of your connection? Do they want a personal relationship with their bank teller, or quick in-and-out transactions and an easy way to get a refund for an accidental overcharge? Most customers don’t want to be “wowed;” they want an effortless experience.</p>
                              <p>In this enlightening keynote session, Matt Dixon, co-author of <em>The Effortless Experience</em>, will explain how a company’s ability to deliver on basic promises and solve day-to-day problems drives customer loyalty. He will share case studies that will inspire us to conquer the new battleground for customer loyalty.</p>

                <p><strong>Stephen M. R. Covey</strong> is a cofounder of CoveyLink and the FranklinCovey Speed of Trust Practice. A sought-after and compelling keynote speaker and advisor on trust, leadership, ethics and high performance, he speaks to audiences around the world. He is the <em>New York Times</em> and #1 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> bestselling author of <em>The SPEED of Trust</em>, a groundbreaking and paradigm-shifting book that challenges our age-old assumption that trust is merely a soft, social virtue and instead demonstrates that trust is a hard-edged, economic driver. He and business partner Greg Link also co- authored <em>Smart Trust: The Defining Skill That Transforms Managers Into Leaders</em>, which shares enlightening principles and anecdotes of people and organizations that are achieving unprecedented success from high-trust relationships and cultures.</p>
                <p>Mr. Covey is the former CEO of Covey Leadership Center, which, under his stewardship, became the largest leadership development company in the world. He personally led the strategy that propelled his father's book, Dr. Stephen R. Covey's <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>, to one of the two most influential business books of the 20th Century, according to <em>CEO Magazine</em>. A Harvard MBA, he joined Covey Leadership Center as a client developer and later became national sales manager and then president & CEO.</p>
                <p>Under his direction, the company grew rapidly and profitably, achieving Inc. 500 status. As president &amp; CEO, he nearly doubled revenues to over $110 million while increasing profits by 12 times. During that period, both customer and employee trust reached new highs and the company expanded throughout the world into over 40 countries. This greatly increased the value of the brand and company. The company was valued at only $2.4 million when Covey was named CEO, and, within three years, he grew shareholder value to $160 million in a merger he orchestrated with then Franklin Quest to form FranklinCovey.</p>
                <p>Over the years, Mr. Covey has gained considerable respect and influence with executives and leaders of Fortune 500 companies as well as with mid- and small-sized private sector and public sector organizations he has consulted. Clients recognize his unique perspective on real-world organizational issues based on his practical experience as a former CEO.</p>
                <p>Covey currently serves on the board/advisory board of several entities, including the Human Performance Institute—the leader in energy management technology—where he serves as advisory board chairman.</p>

                <p><strong>Patricia Gabow</strong>, during her 40-year medical career, was an academic nephrologist, physician administrator, and contributor to national health policy. As a nephrologist, she was a clinician, teacher and investigator with emphasis on fluid and electrolyte balance and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Dr. Gabow was principal investigator on the largest clinical NIH Program Project Grant in Polycystic Kidney Disease for 15 years, which produced seminal observations. She also authored over 150 articles and book chapters.</p>
                <p>As a physician leader, she served as director of medical services (chair), medical director (chief medical officer) and finally as the CEO of Denver Health, a large integrated public healthcare system. During her leadership of Denver Health she led the transformation of a struggling public hospital system into a model integrated, high quality, fiscally stable system. This was accomplished in five steps: managing finances to put the system in black where it remained for the 20 years of her leadership, despite providing $4.7 billion of uninsured care; moving the entire integrated delivery system from a city government department, which it had been for 135 years, to an independent, governmental entity, enabling flexibility and innovation while maintaining public accountability; investing over $300 million dollars in the physical plant, creating state-of-the-art facilities for vulnerable populations; investing over $400 million in information technology, providing robust data and tools to improve quality, accountability and efficiency; and creating and adopting innovations such as advice nurse lines, school-based clinics, standardized computer order sets, and Toyota Production/lean to improve the accessibility, quality, and cost of care by adapting tools from other industries.</p>
                <p>Dr. Gabow’s contributions to national health policy are reflected in her appointments to the Commonwealth Commission on a High Performing Health System, the federal Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC, 17 members), the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Board, the National Governors’ Association Health Advisory Committee, and the Aspen Group. She is also a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.</p>

                <p><strong>Ken Snyder</strong> developed an interest in Japanese business practices while living in Japan during the time he was a student. His interest led him to major in Japanese history and then to pursue an MBA for the purpose of working with a Japanese business expanding to the United States. Inspired by the work of Professors Mike Yoshino and William Ouchi, Ken wrote his master’s thesis on “Applying Japanese Business Practices in American Companies.”</p>
                <p>Immediately after graduation, Snyder joined a Japanese electronics manufacturing company and helped lead the establishment of its U.S. affiliate company. As plant manager, and later president of the Japanese affiliate company, Ken led the company through the implementation of TQC, QC Circles, JIT and kanban initiatives. After over ten years with the Japanese affiliate company, Ken led the startup of Progressive Impressions International (PII) in Bloomington, Illinois. In addition to implementing initiatives similar to what was implemented in the Japanese affiliate company, Ken also created a “lean accounting” system even before that term existed. Snyder led the growth of PII from pre-revenue to over $25 million in annual revenues. Before joining the Huntsman School, Snyder was president of Marketing Communication Inc., an operating division of Taylor Corporation, where he directed a group of six companies while growing revenues of the group from $25 million to over $80 million. He joined the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business in 2008.</p>
                <p>Ken has served on numerous boards, including as a member of the Shingo Institute Executive Advisory Board since 2009. Ken has also been a Shingo examiner since 2010.

              <p><strong>John Black</strong> is one of the nation’s leading authorities on lean operations. Most recently, his consulting team worked to deploy the Saskatchewan Healthcare Management System, based on the Toyota Management System, across the province. The Saskatchewan Healthcare Management System employs 43,000 healthcare professionals in approximately 270 facilities, serving 1.1 million residents with an annual budget of $5 billion. In just three years, this implementation significantly reduced healthcare defects, increased capacity and saved millions of dollars.</p>
              <p>Mr. Black’s career of service to country and corporate America spans almost five decades. He is a lean pioneer who has become known as an expert on the application of lean operations to the healthcare industry. Through his consulting work, major healthcare systems such as Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle and Park Nicollet Health Services in Minneapolis have proven that lean principles profoundly enhance patient satisfaction and organizational safety, quality, efficiency and profitability. Substantially as a result of the work of John Black and Associates, Virginia Mason was named “Top Hospital of the Decade in 2010” by the Leapfrog Group.</p>
              <p>In the 1980s, Mr. Black was a pioneer of lean operations at Boeing and appointed to President Reagan’s White House Council on Productivity, among other honors. Through principles and procedures recommended by Mr. Black, the Boeing 757 program enjoyed substantial improvements in costs, methods and employee morale detailed in a <em>Harvard Business Review</em> case study. Perhaps his greatest achievement at Boeing was helping innovate the first moving assembly line in aerospace, one based on Toyota Production System (lean) principles.</p>

              <p><strong>William Brou Gautier</strong> is president of TSD’s Government Sector with primary responsibility for government support and military-based projects, such as TSD's process development, implementation and integration support for the Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center (AFIMSC). </p>
              <p>Mr. Gautier, a six sigma master black belt, lean-six sigma black belt and project manager, has extensive and significant lean-continuous process improvement (lean-CPI) experience, as both a leader and on-the-ground change agent. Just before joining TSD, he assembled and led a team of 12 architects, business analysts, software developers and certified information systems security personnel in their use of lean-six sigma principles and tools to examine and map a $950 million IT program. The resulting analysis and proposed improvements resulted in a projected savings of $145 million. </p> 
              <p>In 2012, Mr. Gautier retired as a colonel with a distinguished 25-year career in the US Air Force. Having spent most of his career in operations as an instructor pilot in the C-141 and KC-135, his last assignment was director of Air Force Smart Ops 21 (AFSO21 - the Air Force-wide lean-CPI program), HQ Pacific Air Forces at Hickam AFB in Hawaii. While there, he reported directly to the 4-star commander, advising on strategies, tactics, policy and procedures to improve command effectiveness, readiness and efficiency. He supervised 25 black and green belts while leading 4 numbered air forces, 10 wings and 16 directorates in lean-CPI through strategy-to-task execution assessment and business case analyses. He led command-wide strategy for implementation and mentored commanders and directors in problem-solving and lean-CPI tools and methods. </p>
              <p>While a commander, Mr. Gautier earned his black belt certification through the University of Tennessee, and under the guidance of his mentors – TSD’s Chairman, John Allen and CEO, Mike Smith – he applied lean six sigma principles in a re-boot of all organically owned processes, and crafted leader development and combat readiness training that set the standard, resulting in 100% compliant inspections and “Best in AF” honors</p>. 
              <p>As a master black belt and executive, commanders, CIOs, CTOs, senior executive service members and government leaders have relied on his counsel and event leadership across a spectrum ranging from maximizing contract ROI and authoring enterprise IT architecture analysis, to developing PMO governance support business cases and root-cause mitigation strategies for complex problems.</p> 
              <p>Mr. Gautier earned a bachelor’s degree from the US Air Force Academy, a master’s degree in air mobility from the Air Force Institute of Technology, and an MBA from Auburn University.</p>

                <p><strong>Mark Martinez</strong> leads the Operations and Business (O&amp;B) organization at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Mr. Martinez is responsible for leading a diverse organization including: supply chain management, technical information, strategic human resources, project management, project controls, construction management, property management, facility and infrastructure management, business management, maintenance management, emergency preparedness, environmental restoration, sustainable energy management, and nuclear operations teams.</p>
                <p>Throughout Mr. Martinez’s 20-year career at the Laboratory, he has demonstrated the ability to make significant improvements through the use of continuous improvement processes and implementation of operational excellence principles. He has a comprehensive knowledge of programmatic priorities through his experience and expertise in leading diverse teams working on large-scale, challenging problems, as well as hands-on experience in complex operations management.</p>
                <p>Mr. Martinez applied the <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em> while managing nuclear facilities at LLNL. This effort had two major successes. First, in a time when nuclear facility requirements were increasing dramatically, the operating costs for LLNL’s nuclear facilities stabilized and subsequently were reduced and remain in effect today. Second, a dramatic culture improvement focusing on <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em> led to >99% planned facility availability, including any impacts from regulatory oversight. Mr. Martinez is now using these same principles in leading the O&B organization to efficiently and effectively enable the national security mission for all of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p>
                <p>He joined LLNL in 1994, after holding positions at both Martin Marietta Systems and Westinghouse Idaho Nuclear Company in support of Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation activities at the Laboratory. Mr. Martinez has held a progressive set of senior leadership roles: test director for underground nuclear experiments at the Nevada Test Site, deputy program leader of the Nevada Experiments and Operations Program, program leader for the Nuclear Materials Technology Program, head of operations in Weapons and Complex Integration, and currently as the principal associate director for Business and Operations.

The Shingo Prize, which is administered by the Shingo Institute, is regarded as the premier operational excellence award and recognition program in the world with <em>Business Week</em> dubbing it as “the Nobel Prize of Manufacturing.” For over 10 years, Mr. Raymer developed and trained Shingo examiners and 1000s of individuals worldwide on how to assess and implement lean transformation by applying the <em>Shingo Model</em> and its ten <em>Shingo Guiding Principles</em>. He continues to lecture at the Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University in graduate courses, such as Leadership and Operational Excellence in a Global Context, and Principles of Operational Excellence – where he brings practical application to the theoretical philosophy of excellence.</p>
              <p>In 2006, Mr. Raymer pioneered a concept called key behavior indicators (KBI) with organizations such as Daimler, Goodyear Tire, Christie Clinic and Medtronic. Organizations are usually familiar with key performance indicators (KPI) but often fail to focus on the behavior in how to achieve such performance results. This is why we often see work-a-rounds, fire-fighting and heroic efforts to achieve results. With the combining of the two (KPI and KBI), the Institute for Enterprise Excellence has led the development of learning and application of behavior-based strategy deployment; building systems to drive the right behavior; mapping principle-behavior, systems and tools; and internal assessments focusing on KBI and KPI.</p>
