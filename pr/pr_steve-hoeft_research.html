        <h5><strong>“The Power of Ideas to Transform Healthcare” by Steve Hoeft and Robert Pryor Receives Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award </strong></h5>
        <p>Summary: After trained examiners and accomplished business professionals performed a thorough assessment of their work, Steve Hoeft and Dr. Robert Pryor have been selected as recipients of an internationally recognized award from the Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. The authors will receive their award at the 28th International Shingo Conference occurring April 25-29, 2016.</p>
				<p>LOGAN, Utah — The Shingo Institute, part of the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, has awarded Steve Hoeft and Robert W. Pryor, MD with the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for their book, “The Power of Ideas to Transform Healthcare: Engaging Staff by Building Daily Lean Management Systems.” Hoeft, also a 2011 Shingo Research Award recipient, is the senior vice president and chief of operations excellence at Baylor Scott &amp; White Health (BSWH), the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in the state of Texas with 46 hospitals and more than 500 access points. Dr. Pryor is president, chief operating officer and chief medical officer at BSWH.</p>
				<p>“Receipt of the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award signifies an author's significant contribution to advancing the body of knowledge regarding enterprise excellence,” said Ken Snyder, executive director of the Shingo Institute.</p>
				<p>Many companies conduct lean training and projects, but few have tapped the wealth of ideas in the minds of their staff like Baylor Scott &amp; White Health (BSWH). This book documents the path Hoeft and Pryor created at Scott &amp; White. They share what worked as well as what didn't, illustrating over eight years of successes and failures in detail. “The Power of Ideas to Transform Healthcare” explains that the new "currency" for 2015 and beyond will be ideas—ideas brought out in projects, problem solving and especially in "huddles." The most significant concept in this book is not huddles. Instead it's who builds the systems around them and why. The authors share hundreds of pictures, forms, tools and tips. Describing how to engage all staff and draw out their ideas in daily huddles, the book offers ways that staff can try out their ideas without spending too much time away from their work. Although the book focuses on healthcare, the management systems described, along with the lessons learned and best practices, will work in almost any industry.</p>
				<p>Mark Graban, a two-time Shingo Research Award-winning author of “Lean Hospitals” and co-author of “Healthcare Kaizen,” says: “This book is built upon rock-solid foundations, bringing the daily lean management system to life through their stories and examples. Hoeft and Pryor colorfully demonstrate how staff ideas and a broader lean management system greatly benefit patients, staff, physicians and the health system. Lean is not just a set of tools or a series of projects, and this book is full of inspiration and practical advice for everybody who needs to participate actively in a lean transformation, starting with the CEO and other senior leaders. This is a must-read.”
				<p>By “challenging” or applying for an award, authors invite a group of accomplished professionals and trained examiners from the Shingo Institute to thoroughly review their publications. Shingo examiners select recipients based on a rigorous set of standards.
				<p>Hoeft and Pryor will receive the award during the Awards Gala of the 28th International Shingo Conference in Washington D.C. The conference is a five-day event featuring a selection of workshops, plant tours, keynote speakers and breakout sessions designed to provide ongoing knowledge, insights and experience for organizations in pursuit of operational excellence.</p>
        <h5><strong>About the Shingo Institute</strong></h5>
        <p>Housed at the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University, the Shingo Institute is named after Japanese industrial engineer <a href="http://shingo.org/about/">Shigeo Shingo</a>. Shingo distinguished himself as one of the world's thought leaders in concepts, management systems and improvement techniques that have become known as the Toyota Business System. Drawing from Shingo's teachings and years of experience working with organizations throughout the world, the Shingo Institute has developed the <em>Shingo Model™</em> which is the basis for several educational offerings including workshops, study tours and conferences. It also awards and recognizes organizations that demonstrate an exceptional culture that continually strives for improvement and progress. Those interested in more information or in registering to attend the 28th International Shingo Conference may visit <a href="http://www.shingo.org">www.shingo.org</a>.</p>
				<h5><strong>Testimonials</strong></h5>
				<p>The joint wisdom and experience of Hoeft/Pryor makes this book both fun to read and a great resource for organization leaders and internal consultants tasked with improving processes. While the fit for healthcare is obvious, the practices they have so succinctly described will benefit any workplace.
				<em>―Cindy Jimmerson, Author and Founder of Lean Healthcare West</em></p>

				<p>Lean healthcare has become a buzzword and as such often gets mired in the bureaucracy of ineffective programs. Steve and Bob give us deep insight into the philosophy and thinking essential to making Lean healthcare a way of putting innovative ideas to work to achieve breakthrough performance for patients, team members, and the institution.
				<em>―Jeffrey K. Liker, Ph.D., Shingo Prize-Winning Author of The Toyota Way</em></p>

				<p>This book is built upon rock-solid foundations, bringing the daily Lean management system to life through their stories and examples. Hoeft and Pryor colorfully demonstrate how staff ideas and a broader Lean management system greatly benefit patients, staff, physicians, and the health system. Lean is not just a set of tools or a series of projects, and this book is full of inspiration and practical advice for everybody who needs to participate actively in a Lean transformation, starting with the CEO and other senior leaders. This is a must-read.
				<em>―Mark Graban, Shingo Prize-Winning Author of Lean Hospitals and Co-Author of Healthcare Kaizen</em></p>

				<p>... The Scott &amp; White system, at the time this book was written, counted 2,000 implemented ideas for improvement from employees per week from their 16,000 employees, this in an environment that included recent budget and staff cuts. That number is unheard of in my experience outside of a few high volume, low variety automotive manufacturers, mainly Toyota and some of its suppliers.</p>
				<p>That level of employee engagement is for me the sine qua non of a successful Lean implementation supported by a robust Lean management system. ... Steve Hoeft is a teacher and coach with firsthand experience in Toyota’s thinking and approach. Pryor knew the direction he wanted to go: sustained high levels of employee engagement in improving S&amp;W’s performance. Together, they developed an approach to move in that direction. Either would tell you they’re far from done. But the distance they’ve traversed and the progress they’ve made stands as a significant achievement, chronicled in the pages that follow ... This book documents the path the authors created at Scott & White ... It’s a systematic approach, and it’s working.... It entails taking leaders through a process wherein they persuade themselves of the value of sharing, with front-line staffers, their managerial discretion to define problems worth working on. When that happens, it holds the promise to improve the entire organization’s performance in ways others will find difficult to duplicate. The goal is worthy, the journey is worth making. 
				<em>―David Mann, Ph.D., Shingo Prize-Winning Author of Creating a Lean Culture, Third Edition</em></p>

				<p>The Power of Ideas to Transform Healthcare is an invaluable tool for any organization seeking to align their objectives from the system level to the front line―and that should be all organizations. In it, Hoeft and Pryor describe a practical approach to developing a culture of continuous improvement by engaging employees in problem-solving and developing a management system to support it at all levels.
				<em>―Chris Van Gorder, FACHE, President and Chief Executive Officer, Scripps Health</em></p>

				<p>The pursuit of Lean thinking is not a top down process, it is a way of allowing everyone to do what is best for the patient in the most effective and efficient manner. Bob and Steve’s book gives great insight on how this is done in healthcare.
				<em>―C. Courtland Huber, Ph.D., Past Director of the Executive M.B.A. Program at the McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin</em></p>
